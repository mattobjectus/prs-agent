# Explore Our Acoustic Line

## OUR BUILD PHILOSOPHY

PRS acoustics are built on the theory that an acoustic guitar should act like a speaker cabinet: the back and sides strongly braced to lock them down and a thin top braced with a hybrid X/Classical bracing pattern to encourage the top to vibrate more freely. This theory was developed after studying an extraordinary-sounding Torres nylon-string acoustic that was similarly braced. Many acoustic guitars are thought of as double-diaphragm instruments, allowing the back to be one of the vibrating surfaces. This allows for some of the guitar's energy, tone, and volume to be lost through the back of the instrument and dulled by the player's body. If you want a strong, loud acoustic, all the energy and sound should project through the top. This build philosophy allows PRS acoustics to project boldly and gives them their signature sound.

## Bracing

## PRS LADDER-STYLE BACK & SIDE BRACING

PRS acoustics are strongly braced on the back and sides. We think of this part of the guitar like a speaker cabinet - it is locked down to help push the sound through the front of the guitar.

## PRS HYBRID X / CLASSICAL TOP BRACING

PRS Hybrid X/Classical bracing is designed to promote the top's vibration, which helps the instrument project much like the cone of a speaker. The X-brace is designed to keep steel-string acoustic tops from lifting (by crossing behind the bridge, the X-brace counterbalances the pull of the strings). This style of fan bracing is typically found on classical, nylon-string acoustics. By fanning across the belly of the guitar, this bracing helps the top to vibrate.

## BODY SHAPES

## Angelus Cutaway

PRS Angelus Cutaway models are named after the Latin word for “angel” and have responsive highs, crisply-defined lows, and sweet midrange. The cutaway body shape provides increased access to the higher frets. Though well suited for fingerstyle players, these models are versatile enough for myriad musical styles.

## Tonare Grand

Tonare models are named after the Latin word for “thunder” and offer substantial volume and midrange and beefy low end with balanced highs. Wonderful for strumming, these guitars also lend themselves to flatpickers as well as nuanced players.

## Tonare Parlor

Tonare Parlor acoustics, also named for the word “thunder,” are a smaller overall size, but maintain the bold projection of PRS acoustics with a more focused tone. These guitars also feature a shorter scale length and are very comfortable to play for hours on end.

## Tonewoods

While many other factors affect the ultimate tone of the guitar, the woods used to build an acoustic guitar are the foundation of the instrument and its tone. Different woods have different densities and different stiffnesses, for example, which translate to different resonant frequencies and degrees of sustain. Here are a few examples of woods used on PRS acoustic back and sides and some general attributes for each.

## Mahogany

- Midrange forward tone
- Warm and “woody”
- Mahogany-spec'd acoustics are great for solo players, considering their direct tonal character
## Ovankol

- Wide tonal spectrum
- Lush and full
- Ovangkol is similar to rosewood in tone and complements many playing styles
## Ziricote

- Full bottom end and rolled-off highs
- Rich and broad
- Ziricote-spec'd acoustics offer hi-fi tone reminiscent of some vintage acoustics
## Maple

- Depth and transparency of tone
- Bright and clean
- PRS maple-spec'd acoustics have more warmth than many other maple acoustics on the market
## ADDITIONAL FEATURES

## Bone Nut/Saddle

All PRS acoustics feature bone nuts and saddles. One of the tenents of guitar making at PRS is: “anything that touches the string is God.” The nut and saddle on an acoustic are the two main points where the energy (vibration) of the string is transferred through the guitar. Bone is a hard material (that can still be shaped to fit) and helps the guitar to sustain longer with more tonal character.

## PRS Double-Action Truss Rod

The PRS double-action truss rod provides neck adjustments in both directions, allowing our necks to be fully adjustable. The double acting rod achieves twice the amount of adjustment as a single acting rod with the same amount of movement of the adjusting nut.

## PRS-Voiced Fishman Presys VT Pickup*

EQ'd in Paul Reed Smith's home studio and implemented by Larry Fishman and his engineering team, the PRS-Voiced Fishman Presys VT Pickup provides players with a warm, organic tone that allows the natural sound of the instrument to come through.

## Ebony Fretboard and Bridge*

*All PRS SE Series acoustics come with an ebony fretboard and bridge and PRS-Voiced Fishman Presys VT pickup. Private Stock acoustics may use other materials.

# SE Chleo

# Awaken The Dragon

“With the PRS SE Chleo, we set out to create the best affordable guitar that delivers a unique combination of effortless playability, outstanding craftsmanship, and versatile tonal range. It combines modern innovations with classic style, giving players the tools they need to create everything from classic tones to cutting edge new sounds. The SE Chleo proves that a world-class instrument doesn’t have to break the bank—it’s a guitar that brings high-end performance within reach for everyone.” – Herman Li, DragonForce

The PRS SE Chleo is the result of an intimate collaboration between PRS Guitars and award-winning guitar player Herman Li. Li, best known for his work as one of the lead guitar players in the power metal band DragonForce, is a demanding guitarist known for his fast and precise playing style. Based on the exclusive 2025 PRS Chleo Limited Edition, this SE signature model is a unique guitar in the PRS lineup designed with the modern metal guitarist in mind.

The PRS SE Chleo features a maple top and mahogany back with maple neck and ebony fretboard. The body features a sculpted carve that allows it to be very thin and very lightweight overall, so you can play longer and with more energy. The neck shape and neck joint were specially designed to be comfortable and fast. The neck is very thin front-to-back with a slightly taller playing surface and 20” fretboard radius, and the added high-modulus carbon fiber strength rods ensure a strong neck that promotes sustain. The fretboard features “Eclipse Dragon” inlays, and PRS’s trademark scoop has also been modified for ultimate access to the upper frets. All this plus a Floyd Rose locking tremolo mean you can dig in and play hard without sacrifice.

The PRS SE Chleo boasts the same signature pickups as the Limited Edition that preceded it. The Fishman Fluence Signature Series Omniforce Herman Li pickups feature copper-free layered PCB’s for consistency and no-hum tones. With three distinct voices and a versatile switching system, the guitar offers up to 13 unique tone combinations. From fat, aggressive rhythm tones to smooth, warm leads, soaring screams, and crystal-clear single-coil sounds, these pickups cover it all. The performance-friendly control layout makes it easy to switch between tones on the fly. Whether you’re using high-gain tube amps, modern amp modelers, or DAW plugins, the Chleo’s pickups are built to shine across any setup.

Push boundaries and forge your own ground with the PRS SE Chleo.

## Featured Specifications

### Floyd Rose 1000 Tremolo w/ PRS Locking Nut

Low-profile design. Made to stay in tune through the heaviest dive-bombing sessions.

### PRS-Designed Tuners

Designed to PRS's specifications, these lightweight tuners provide precise tuning and won't dampen your tone.

### Fishman Fluence Omniforce Pickups - Herman Li Signature

Featuring three distinct voices per pickup and a versatile switching system, the Omniforce set offers up to 13 tone combinations — from powerful high-output tones to articulate single-coil sounds. The middle single coil is designed to sit low against the body for improved picking comfort and tonal balance.

### Built to Play Fast

The PRS SE Chleo features a reinforced maple neck with a uniquely thin profile and 20-inch-radiused ebony fretboard, so you can play fast. Its deeper scoop allows ultimate access to all 24 frets.

# Silver Sky

# Reach For The Sky

“It’s been a dream of mine for years to design a guitar that includes some of my favorite vintage specifications but with a modern spirit and aesthetic. After two years of study and refinement, the Silver Sky is my vision of what a reboot of the electric guitar should look and feel like.” – John Mayer

The PRS Silver Sky is an idealized version of a vintage single-coil guitar where every detail adds up and sets this guitar apart from the pack and the past. The result of a close collaboration between Grammy Award-winning musician John Mayer and Paul Reed Smith, the Silver Sky is based off of years of development. Incorporating Mayer and Smith’s favorite elements of 1963 and 1964 instruments with an eye toward modern references, the PRS Silver Sky delivers the warmth and familiarity of an old guitar with the finesse of a brand-new instrument.

Some of the more distinctive specifications include, the headstock shape, tuners, bridge, pickups, and neck and fretboard options. The headstock shape is based on PRS’s trademark design, but inverted both to accommodate Mayer’s playing style and also to keep a consistent length of string behind the nut, which makes staying in tune easier. The tuners are a traditional vintage-style, closed-back tuner, but with PRS’s locking design. The steel tremolo takes the patented PRS design and incorporates Gen III knife-edge screws. Setup flush to the body in the neutral position so that the tremolo bridge only goes down in pitch, the bridge’s increased contact with the body allows the guitar itself to be acoustically louder, which in turn improves the signal to noise ratio of the single-coil pickups. The 635JM single-coil pickups are very round and full, with a musical high end that is never “ice-picky” or brash.

The Silver Sky comes with the option of a rosewood or maple fretboard. The maple fretboard option comes with the original 635JM neck shape, while the rosewood fretboard option has been subtly modified in the shoulders to feel more “rounded” in your hand. Both neck shapes were designed by researching vintage instruments and Mayer test-driving guitars on stage to find what felt right. The fretboard radius on both options is 7.25”.

Other high-quality specifications include a bone nut, a molded metal jack plate (curved to make plugging and unplugging a guitar cable hassle-free), retooled knobs, and PRS’s double action truss rod (accessible from the front of the headstock for ease of use). PRS premium gig bag included.

This model is also available with a maple fretboard. To explore that offering, please click here.

## Accolades

- Premier Guitar

“[The PRS Silver Sky] offers up shockingly good vintage tones and feel, but modern production methods and PRS’s legendary attention to detail have eliminated all the problems that go along with vintage instruments…including the monstrous price tag!”

- Guitar Interactive

“Tonally, it’s big, clear, and airy when played clean, and fat and resonant with overdrive kicked on…There’s so much to dig with this guitar, but most are sure to keep going back to that heel and amazing upper-fret reach, which changes everything.”

- Vintage Guitar

“After playing the Silver Sky, it’s easy to understand why it took so long to design and why John Mayer embraced this endeavor. For aficionados of the classic three single-coil pickup solidbody guitar design, this is truly one of the finest examples ever produced.”

- Guitar World

“A superb vintage and experience-informed three single-coil bolt-on. Build playability, sound and typical PRS attention to detail and quality.”

- Music Radar

"Bottom line: The Silver Sky absolutely delivers on the promise of being a damn-near-perfect version of this type of guitar…Paul Reed Smith doesn’t mess around, and you’ve got to assume that he never would have made this guitar if he didn’t think he could bring something inspiring to the party.”

- Guitar Player

“This is not simply a Strat with a PRS headstock. As Paul Reed Smith pointed out in an interview, every aspect of the guitar was thoughtfully designed, or redesigned. But don’t just take our word for it. Try one out. You may be just as impressed as we are.”

- MusicPlayers.com

"This guitar isn't designed to be just a collector's item that is hung on a wall to look at, it was built to be played and pushed to the limit."

- Maverick Magazine

“You can take as many modern or vintage twists as you want on an instrument. The real question is: does it work on stage or in the studio? Silver Sky works.”

- Clay Cook, Zac Brown Band

“Man I am hooked on this Silver Sky. Can’t stop playing it! The feel and dynamics are really next level.”

- Eric Krasno

“The Silver Sky is the closest anyone has ever come to bettering Leo's original blueprint for the Stratocaster.”

- Mixdown Monthly

# Custom 24

# The One That Started It All

The Custom 24 is the original PRS. Since its introduction, it has offered a unique option for serious players and defined PRS tone and playability.

Played by internationally touring artists, gigging musicians, and aspiring players, the Custom 24 features a figured maple top and mahogany back with a 24-fret, 25” scale length mahogany neck with rosewood fretboard. Anchored by PRS’s patented Gen III tremolo and Phase III tuners with wing buttons the Custom 24 is known for its playability, versatility, and tuning stability.

The Custom 24 is outfitted with PRS DMO treble and bass pickups with volume and tone controls and a 5-way blade switch. DMO (Dynamic, Musical, Open) pickups were personally designed by Paul Reed Smith and the PRS New Products Engineering team. From our own hands-on research into coveted vintage pickup models to advancements in signal analyzation and “tuning” technology, these pickups incorporate every detail of pickup knowledge PRS has gained in recent years of R&D.

PRS DMO pickups have a “wide open” sound with vocal character, meaning they deliver clear, pleasant-sounding tones across a wide range of frequencies (bass to treble) in each pickup.

The Custom 24 is the quintessential PRS guitar. This iconic instrument was the first model that Paul Reed Smith brought to the public at PRS Guitars’ first Winter NAMM show in 1985 and has been a top seller ever since.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo, Gen III

Meticulous design delivering sonic fidelity, player ergonomics, and revolutionary tuning stability.

### PRS Phase III Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

Modern locking technology with vintage elegance, these lightweight tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS DMO Pickups

“Dynamic, Musical, Open” pickups with balanced tonal range and vocal quality.

# Custom 24-08

# Updated Icon

The Custom 24 is the quintessential PRS guitar, the iconic instrument that started it all back in 1985. The Custom 24-08 keeps many of the foundational specs as the original Custom – maple top, mahogany back and neck, 24 frets, 25” scale length, the PRS patented Gen III tremolo, and Phase III tuners with wing buttons – but adds a new level of versatility with its TCI pickups and EQ Mini-toggle switches.

TCI pickups are designed to offer a full, musical sound reminiscent of single-coil and soapbar tones. The dual EQ mini-toggle switches act as tuned high-pass filters when engaged (in the up position), removing shelved low-end and allowing the high frequencies through for more clarity and musical highs.

For classic PRS playability, reliability, and tone with ultimate flexibility, check out the Custom 24-08.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo, Gen III

Meticulous design delivering sonic fidelity, player ergonomics, and revolutionary tuning stability.

### PRS Phase III Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

Modern locking technology with vintage elegance, these lightweight tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS TCI Pickups

Musical pickups that offer versatile tones from spanky singlecoils to full soapbars.

# Custom 24 Piezo

# Electric & Acoustic Tones

The Custom 24 Piezo is a 24-fret solidbody piezo-equipped guitar that effortlessly achieves classic humbucker tones and authentic acoustic sounds in one instrument. With classic PRS appointments, including a figured maple top, mahogany back, 24-fret, 25” scale length mahogany neck with rosewood fretboard, PRS’s patented Gen III tremolo, and Phase III tuners with wing buttons, the Custom 24 Piezo is a unique tool for musicians in the writing room, the studio, and on the stage.

The Custom 24 Piezo boasts PRS DMO treble and bass pickups. PRS’s DMO (Dynamic, Musical, Open) pickups were personally designed by Paul Reed Smith and the PRS New Products Engineering team. From our own hands-on research into coveted vintage pickup models to advancements in signal analyzation and “tuning” technology, these pickups incorporate every detail of pickup knowledge PRS has gained in recent years of R&D. PRS DMO pickups have a “wide open” sound with vocal character, meaning they deliver clear, pleasant-sounding tones across a wide range of frequencies (bass to treble) in each pickup.

Equipped with the traditional volume/tone/5-way blade switch, this model also features a 3-way selector to switch between or blend the magnetic pickups and piezo electronics. The two output jacks allow guitarists to plug into their favorite electric or acoustic guitar amp or DI into a soundboard. By utilizing the separate blend control, the tone of the PRS DMO pickups can also be combined with the piezo acoustic sounds through a single output. With a nearly infinite range of tones, the Custom 24 Piezo is a perfect “go-to” guitar for players of all kinds.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Phase III Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

## Accolades

"The Custom 24 Piezo is without a doubt the best and most versatile guitar I have ever owned. I play them every night live. The piezo system gives us that acoustic sound that we’ve been wanting for years. Our FOH soundman loves them and it makes us sound better without a doubt. I didn’t do any alterations to the specs either. It was perfect right out of the case.”

- Mikael Akerfeldt (Opeth)

# Custom 24 "Floyd"

# Designed For Destruction

The Custom 24 "Floyd" is equipped with the time-tested Floyd Rose "Original" tremolo system and PRS's \ m / (metal) pickups. The Floyd Rose "Original" tremolo and locking nut tuning system is a double-locking design precision-made from high quality steel. This design combination allows players to lock the string at the nut and at the bridge to keep the guitar in tune even during the heaviest dive-bombing sessions.

The Custom 24 is the quintessential PRS guitar. This iconic instrument was the first model that Paul Reed Smith brought to the public at PRS Guitars’ first Winter NAMM show in 1985 and has been a top seller ever since.

## Featured Specifications

### Floyd Rose Tremolo

Precision-made tremolo designed to keep the guitar in tune through even the heaviest dive-bombing sessions.

Built on the tried-and-true foundation of a mahogany back and neck with artist grade maple top, the 40th Anniversary Custom 24 boasts a retro violin top carve, PRS “Old School” birds with outlines, and PRS “Pre-Factory” headstock eagle, all of which pay homage to early PRS guitars. Outside of these aesthetic attributes, the 40th Anniversary Custom 24 is looking ahead with its all-new PRS DMO Treble and Bass pickups. DMO pickups (DMO standing for Dynamic, Musical, Open) were spec’d by Paul Reed Smith and the PRS New Products Engineering team to have a wide open sound with vocal character.

Other classic Custom 24 appointments include the PRS Gen III patented tremolo, PRS Phase III locking tuners with wing buttons, and PRS Signature 10-46 strings. This limited edition also features a ziricote fretboard and headstock veneer.

This commemorative run kicks off a year-long 40th Anniversary celebration for PRS Guitars. Only 400 of this 40th Anniversary Custom 24 Limited Edition will be available. Hand-signed 40th Anniversary certificate included.

# 40th Anniversary Custom 24-08 Semi-Hollow Limited Edition

# Expansive. Expressive. Elevated.

Introducing the 40th Anniversary Custom 24-08 Semi-Hollow Limited Edition, celebrating four decades of PRS Guitars. The Custom 24-08 keeps many of the foundational specs as the original Custom – the guitar that started PRS back in 1985 – but adds a new level of versatility with its TCI pickups and EQ mini-toggle switches. This limited-edition instrument also features a semi-hollow body, ziricote fretboard and headstock veneer, and special inlay package.

The 40th Anniversary Custom 24-08 Semi-Hollow Limited Edition starts with a “10-top” grade figured maple top, mahogany back and neck, and a ziricote fretboard. This wood combination, along with our thorough wood drying processes, creates a stable and resonant foundation. The addition of semi-hollow construction adds an even fuller organic quality to the tone, while the f-hole also adds an elegant visual touch.

Now made with American alnico and updated build specs, TCI pickups are designed to offer a full, musical sound reminiscent of single-coil and soapbar tones. The dual EQ mini-toggle switches act as tuned high-pass filters when engaged (in the up position), removing shelved low-end and allowing the high frequencies through for more clarity and musical highs.

“The EQ switches were developed with and first featured on the Private Stock John McLaughlin model in 2023. Both John and I felt that they offered a different, but just as versatile, sound that played a significant role in the musicality of that guitar. I am happy that we are now extending this feature into more models.” – Paul Reed Smith

Additional specifications for this instrument include a 24-fret, 25” scale length neck with “old school” birds with outlines designed to feel like home from the moment you pick it up, the PRS Gen III patented tremolo so you can flutter and divebomb, and Phase III locking tuners with wing buttons to keep you in tune without dulling your sound.

Limited to 300 pieces worldwide, this special edition features both traditional design features and new appointments, making it an essential piece for serious musicians and collectors alike. Only 300 of this 40th Anniversary Custom 24-08 Semi-Hollow Limited Edition will be available. Hand-signed 40th Anniversary certificate included.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo, Gen III

Meticulous design delivering sonic fidelity, player ergonomics, and revolutionary tuning stability.

### PRS Phase III Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

Modern locking technology with vintage elegance, these lightweight tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS TCI Pickups

Musical pickups that offer versatile tones from spanky singlecoils to full soapbars.

# 40th Anniversary Custom 24 Satin Limited Edition

# A New Twist on a Classic

The 40th Anniversary Custom 24 Satin Limited Edition celebrates four decades of PRS Guitars by bringing some new and noteworthy features to the model that started it all. Limited to 500 pieces worldwide, this special edition uniquely features a mango top, ebony fretboard, satin nitro finish, and smoked black hardware for a new twist on a classic.

Most notably, this limited edition exchanges the Custom 24’s classic maple for a striking figured mango top. Mango wood retains much of the sound characteristics as maple while bringing an almost “quilted” look to these guitars. The satin nitro finish adds to the guitar’s unique aesthetic appeal by bringing a more natural vibe to the instrument – along with great feel and resonant tone. The ebony fretboard and headstock veneer feature PRS “Old School” birds with outlines and a PRS “Pre-Factory” eagle on the headstock, which both pay homage to early PRS guitars.

While the guitar may look different, it boasts many of the Custom 24’s beloved features, including a mahogany back and neck, 25” scale length, 24 frets, 10” fretboard radius, and Pattern Thin shape. Other classic Custom 24 appointments include the PRS Gen III patented tremolo, PRS Phase III locking tuners with wing buttons, and PRS Signature 10-46 strings. The 40th Anniversary Custom 24 Satin Limited Edition is equipped with PRS’s DMO Treble and Bass pickups. DMO pickups (DMO standing for Dynamic, Musical, Open) were spec’d by Paul Reed Smith and the PRS New Products Engineering team to have a wide-open sound with vocal character. Paired with a 5-way blade switch, these pickups give players plenty of tonal range in their dual octave package.

This commemorative run continues PRS’s year-long 40th Anniversary celebration. Only 500 of this 40th Anniversary Custom 24 Satin Limited Edition will be available. Hand-signed 40th Anniversary certificate included.

# 40th Anniversary McCarty SC56 Limited Edition

# Vintage Soul. Modern Precision.

The 40th Anniversary PRS McCarty SC56 Limited Edition captures the essence of a golden era of electric guitar design while delivering the playability and reliability that today’s musicians demand. With a classic PRS single-cutaway body shape and carefully chosen specifications, the McCarty SC56 is both a tribute to tradition and a modern performer’s dream. Anchored by a maple top and mahogany back, with a 22-fret, 24.594” scale length Pattern Vintage neck, the McCarty SC56 is designed for rich, resonant tone and effortless playability. The 24.594” scale length and slightly thicker back give the McCarty SC56 a warm, woody voice and comfortable feel, while its Phase III non-locking tuners and PRS two-piece bridge anchor the guitar and promote its musical sustain. The heart of the 40th Anniversary McCarty SC56 Limited Edition lies in its pickups: a pair of PRS McCarty III pickups, meticulously designed to deliver warm, clear tone with exceptional note separation and dynamics. Controlled by a simple and elegant layout — two volume controls, two tone controls, and a 3-way toggle on the upper bout — the McCarty SC56 keeps the player focused on feel and sound. With appointments like binding on the fretboard, classic bird inlays, and a vintage-inspired nitrocellulose finish, the 40th Anniversary McCarty SC56 Limited Edition blends heritage and innovation into a timeless instrument. Whether you’re chasing pure vintage tone or seeking a reliable stage companion, the McCarty SC56 stands ready. PRS 40th Anniversary McCarty SC56 – 400 Piece Limited Edition

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Two-Piece Bridge

Made of zinc and brass, this bridge has four contact points and added mass, enhancing the natural tone of the guitar and helping to create a more resonant instrument.

### PRS Phase III Non-Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

With vintage elegance, these lightweight tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS McCarty III Pickups

Vintage-inspired pickups that bring a vocal clarity to their full, warm tone.

### Weight-Relief Design

Single-cutaway guitars are known to be heavier than their double-cutaway counterparts. This design incorporates weight-relief, decreasing the weight of the guitar by about 2/3 of a pound, while maintaining several points of attachment between the guitar top and back to eliminate the “hollow” sound of the cavities and promote tone transfer.

# McCarty

# A Legacy of Innovation

Named after Ted McCarty, a pioneer of the electric guitar and musical instrument industry, the McCarty model embodies the most up-to-date findings from PRS and looks back to the golden age of the guitar. This vintage-appointed guitar features a bound, 22-fret Pattern neck and a slightly thicker back for enhanced tone and sustain. The PRS McCarty model is anchored by a stoptail bridge with brass inserts and non-locking PRS Phase III tuners with brass shafts for added resonance and sustain.

The PRS McCarty is outfitted with McCarty III treble and bass pickups. McCarty III pickups were spec’d by Paul Reed Smith and the PRS New Products Engineering team. From our own hands-on research into coveted vintage pickup models to advancements in signal analyzation and “tuning” technology, these pickups incorporate every detail of pickup knowledge PRS has gained in recent years of R&D. PRS McCarty III pickups are vintage-inspired humbuckers that bring a vocal clarity to their full, warm tone. Paired with a push/pull tone control and a 3-way toggle pickup switch, these pickups provide a complete palette of tones.

In the late 1980’s, Paul Reed Smith called on Ted McCarty to consult with him on guitar design and production techniques. He not only served as a mentor but became a great friend of Paul and everyone he met at PRS. In 1994, PRS released the first McCarty, an instrument that incorporated the full spectrum of techniques and knowledge Paul had gained from Ted as well as Paul’s own experiences as a guitar builder.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Stoptail with Brass Inserts

Engineered with curved string slots with brass inserts and brass studs to take full advantage of the resonant properties of the guitar.

### PRS Phase III Non-Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

With vintage elegance, these lightweight tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS McCarty III Pickups

Vintage-inspired pickups that bring a vocal clarity to their full, warm tone.

# McCarty 594

# Vintage Heart with Modern Playability

The McCarty 594 is a versatile, vintage-inspired instrument with modern playability and reliability. Featuring a bound 22-fret Pattern Vintage neck and slightly thicker back for more enhanced tone and sustain, the McCarty 594 plays in tune, is intonated the entire length of the neck, and feels like a guitar you’ve been playing forever. Whether you are looking for rich, authentic humbucking tones or nuanced, sweet single-coil sounds, the McCarty 594 can seamlessly master both sonic territories thanks to its McCarty III pickups and dual volume and push/pull tone controls.

McCarty III pickups were spec’d by Paul Reed Smith and the PRS New Products Engineering team. From our own hands-on research into coveted vintage pickup models to advancements in signal analyzation and “tuning” technology, these pickups incorporate every detail of pickup knowledge PRS has gained in recent years of R&D. PRS McCarty III pickups are vintage-inspired humbuckers that bring a vocal clarity to their full, warm tone. A zinc two-piece bridge with brass saddles and steel studs, bone nut, and PRS Phase III tuners with brass shafts anchor this guitar and stay true to the promise of the McCarty family.

“One of my sayings is that everything that touches the string is God – well, that’s really the bridge, the nut, and the tuners. These specifications make a huge difference in the guitar’s tone, sustain, and character.” – Paul Reed Smith.

In the late 1980’s, Paul Reed Smith called on Ted McCarty to consult with him on guitar design and production techniques. He not only served as a mentor but became a great friend of Paul and everyone he met at PRS. In 1994, PRS released the first McCarty, an instrument that incorporated the full spectrum of techniques and knowledge Paul had gained from Ted as well as his own experiences as a guitar builder.

## Accolades

"The 594 is the best new guitar I've played in years. It has a vintage heart and soul but without the technical limitations that usually come along with an old instrument. What good is an old guitar if you can't get all that feel out of the upper frets, or the intonation is off? To hear that old PAF sound but be able to articulate the notes in a way that only modern manufacturing could allow is so exciting."

- John Mayer

"It's engineered beautifully and really lives up to the idea of getting the best attributes of an old instrument, I love the two volume/two tone layout, while still keeping the overall feel of a PRS. The pickups sound great and really have the vibe of old PAF's that aren't wound too hot."

- Jimmy Herring, Widespread Panic

"I could go on and on about how fabulous this thing sounds, how beautifully it plays and intonates, the exquisite workmanship, etc. Instead let me just say that I’ve played a lot of guitars in general and PRS guitars in particular...and this is one of the finest instruments I have ever encountered."

- Guitar Player

"The new McCarty 594 is extremely versatile. With individual volume, tone and coil tap pulls I’m able to create a wide enough variety of tones that it has minimized my guitar changes on this year’s Toby Keith Interstates & Tailgates tour to almost none!"

- Rich Eckhardt, Toby Keith

"So... you guys knocked this one out of the park. It’s... kinda freaking me out a bit. Causing me to re-think my touring set and I have only been playing it for two hours. I am not really sure what to say, I have two “Holy Grail” guitars that do most of my heavy lifting in the set, but this one is going to be banging it’s head to work its way in. I am a bit stunned. The 594 sounded like a good concept on paper, but....just wow. This is a killer."

- John Wesley Dearth, Porcupine Tree

# McCarty 594 Hollowbody II

# Timeless Resonance

The McCarty 594 Hollowbody II brings a new set of features to one of our most beloved models: the Hollowbody II. With fully-hollow construction, the Hollowbody II is a resonant guitar with warm, woody tone. The details carried over from the McCarty 594 model impart even more vintage character to this already classic instrument. McCarty III pickups ensure that these guitars are clear and musical while dual volume and push/pull tone controls offer plenty of versatility with both humbucking and single-coil tones on tap.

McCarty III pickups were spec’d by Paul Reed Smith and the PRS New Products Engineering team. From our own hands-on research into coveted vintage pickup models to advancements in signal analyzation and “tuning” technology, these pickups incorporate every detail of pickup knowledge PRS has gained in recent years of R&D. PRS McCarty III pickups are vintage-inspired humbuckers that bring a vocal clarity to their full, warm tone. A zinc two-piece bridge with brass saddles and steel studs, bone nut, and PRS Phase III tuners with brass shafts anchor this guitar and stay true to the promise of the McCarty family.

Whether you are looking for rich, authentic humbucking tones or nuanced, sweet single-coil sounds, the McCarty 594 Hollowbody II will oblige with warmth and resonance. Additional appointments include, a bound, 22-fret, 24.594” scale length Pattern Vintage neck with rosewood fretboard and PRS trademark bird inlays.

In the late 1980’s, Paul Reed Smith called on Ted McCarty to consult with him on guitar design and production techniques.

# Standard 24 Satin

# Raise Your Standards

The PRS Standard harkens back to Paul Reed Smith’s pre-factory all-mahogany guitars. Its all-mahogany construction promotes a warm, full, midrange-forward tone, and its “sinky” satin nitro finish brings a stripped-down look and roadworthy feel to the instrument.

The PRS Standard 24 features many classic PRS specifications, including a 25” scale length, Pattern Thin neck with a 24-fret, 10” radius rosewood fretboard, PRS Patented Tremolo, and PRS Phase III tuners with unplated brass shafts.

Under the hood, the PRS Standard 24 is outfitted with PRS DMO treble and bass pickups with volume and tone controls and a 5-way blade switch. PRS DMO (Dynamic, Musical, Open) pickups have a “wide open” sound with vocal character, meaning they deliver clear, pleasant-sounding tones across a wide range of frequencies (bass to treble) in each pickup. DMO pickups were personally designed by Paul Reed Smith and the PRS New Products Engineering team. From our own hands-on research into coveted vintage pickup models to advancements in signal analyzation and “tuning” technology, these pickups incorporate every detail of pickup knowledge PRS has gained in recent years of R&D.

Raise your standards with this stage- and studio-ready guitar.

# Hollowbody II Piezo

# Electric Power & Acoustic Resonance

With brilliant acoustics and a vast array of tones, the Hollowbody II has been a constant favorite in our dynamic lineup of hollow instruments. The combination of the maple top and back with mahogany sides provides tonal clarity and extraordinary resonance. While the 22-fret, 25” scale length neck delivers familiar comfort and playability.

Featuring PRS McCarty III pickups, the PRS Hollowbody II has a vintage-inspired voice with vocal clarity and full, warm tone. The LR Baggs/PRS Piezo System comes standard, providing musicians with the versatility of wielding both acoustic and electric guitar tones in one instrument. There are two output jacks on the Hollowbody II Piezo, allowing guitarists to plug into their favorite electric guitar or acoustic guitar amp or DI into a soundboard. By utilizing the separate blend control, the tone of the Hollowbody II Piezo's McCarty III pickups can also be combined with acoustic sounds through a single output.

With a nearly infinite range of resonant tones, the PRS Hollowbody II Piezo is a beautiful “go-to” guitar.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Adjustable 'Piezo' Stoptail

Including six individual piezo-equipped saddles, this bridge works with the LR Baggs/PRS proprietary piezo electronics, to effortlessly achieve electric and acoustic sounds in one instrument.

### PRS Phase III Non-Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

With vintage elegance, these lightweight tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS McCarty III Pickups

Vintage-inspired pickups that bring a vocal clarity to their full, warm tone.

## Accolades

"Want sustain and tone that just keeps going....and going....and going, long enough to make Nigel forget what he started? Look no further than the Paul Reed Smith Hollowbody II electric."

- American Songwriter

"CAMILA’s music often goes from soft acoustic guitar arpeggios to power chords and leads, all within the same song. The PRS Hollowbody is my essential tool for achieving those changes in a live situation. I just love the sound of the Piezo and the Humbuckers. I even combine both sounds on some songs and the blend is beautiful. It’s like having two guitars in one. It quickly became my main axe."

- Pablo Hurtado, Camila

# 40th Anniversary Special Semi-Hollow Limited Edition

# Versatility, Elevated.

The 40th Anniversary Special Semi-Hollow Limited Edition marries PRS innovation with distinct wood appointments to bring players an incredible amount of versatility in a unique package. Limited to just 280 pieces worldwide, this special edition features PRS’s McCarty III treble and bass pickups with a proprietary PRS Narrowfield in the center position along with an artist grade figured maple top, black limba back and neck, and Honduran rosewood fretboard and headstock veneer.

The PRS Special Semi-Hollow delivers twelve pickup combinations to players, thanks to the three-pickup configuration paired with a 5-way blade and two mini-toggles. Roll back the tone control for added growl, turn it up for some shimmer, and have fun exploring this versatile tonal palette. The volume level between the humbucking and single-coil settings remains very even, and the semi-hollow body with single f-hole provides welcome airiness and depth to the guitar’s tone.

Other classic appointments include a 25” scale length, 22 frets, 10” fretboard radius, and Pattern neck shape. The PRS “Old School” birds inlays with outlines and a PRS “Pre-Factory” eagle on the headstock both pay homage to early PRS guitars. The PRS Gen III patented tremolo, PRS Phase III locking tuners with wing buttons, and PRS Signature 10-46 strings round out the specs.

This commemorative run continues PRS’s year-long 40th Anniversary celebration. Only 280 of this 40th Anniversary Special Semi-Hollow Limited Edition will be available. Hand-signed 40th Anniversary certificate included.

### PRS Patented Tremolo, Gen III

# Special Semi-Hollow

# Explore Your Sound

The PRS Special Semi-Hollow offers players a versatile hum/”single”/hum configuration with two PRS McCarty III humbuckers and a PRS Narrowfield middle pickup.

McCarty III pickups were spec’d by Paul Reed Smith and the PRS New Products Engineering team. From our own hands-on research into coveted vintage pickup models to advancements in signal analyzation and “tuning” technology, these pickups incorporate every detail of pickup knowledge PRS has gained in recent years of R&D. PRS McCarty III pickups are vintage-inspired humbuckers that bring a vocal clarity to their full, warm tone. PRS Narrowfield pickup in the middle position delivers the bite of a single coil, so it cuts through the mix with plenty of clarity and punch – but without the hum.

Paired with a 5-way blade switch and two mini-toggles that tap the McCarty III humbuckers, this guitar can handle myriad sounds and styles (with twelve pickup combinations in total). Roll back the tone control for added growl, turn it up for some shimmer, and have fun exploring this versatile tonal palette. The volume level between the humbucking and single-coil settings remains very even, and the semi-hollow body with single f-hole provides a welcome airiness and depth to the guitar’s tone.

Additional specifications on the PRS Special Semi-Hollow include a maple top, mahogany back, 22-fret 25” scale length mahogany neck, rosewood fretboard, Phase III locking tuners with wing buttons, and the PRS Gen III patented tremolo.

## Accolades

“It has a resonant acoustic sound, and the pickups do a fine job of capturing that airy character at all volume levels, particularly when the guitar is up loud enough to enjoy the singing, edge-of-feedback sustain that semi-hollows do so well.”

# Desert Island Tone & Versatility

The PRS Studio model is a modern take on a traditional single-single-hum guitar, with PRS’s proprietary Narrowfield pickups in the middle and bass positions and a McCarty III humbucking treble pickup. McCarty III pickups were spec’d by Paul Reed Smith and the PRS New Products Engineering team after years of hands-on research with coveted vintage pickup models and advancements in signal analyzation and “tuning” technology. PRS McCarty III pickups are vintage-inspired humbuckers that bring a vocal clarity to their full, warm tone.

The PRS Studio offers punchy singlecoils, vintage scooped tones, and the chunky kick of a treble humbucker screaming in one instrument. This whole new scope of sounds are only possible with a three-pickup guitar and are easily accessible in the Studio model thanks to the push/pull tone control and 5-way blade switch. With seven combinations in all, the PRS Studio covers classic tones but maintains a unique voice making it a perfect “desert island” guitar.

Other specifications include a maple top, mahogany back and neck, and a rosewood, 22-fret, 25” scale length fretboard with PRS trademark bird inlays. The PRS Studio is anchored by PRS’s patented Gen III trem and Phase IIl Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons, both designed for excellent tuning stability while maximizing the transfer of the strings’ vibration through the instrument.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo, Gen III

Meticulous design delivering sonic fidelity, player ergonomics, and revolutionary tuning stability.

### PRS Phase III Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

Modern locking technology with vintage elegance, these lightweight tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS McCarty III Pickups

## Accolades

"It sounds to us less about copping the sound of a '60s Strat with a hot PAF at the bridge, and more about offering a broad spectrum of fully hum-cancelling voices that sound classy and sophisticated played clean and really quite huge but defined with some crunch and gain. Factor in the feel, the neck shape and the ergonomics and it’s like the best vintage guitar you’ve never owned, certainly not at this price anyway."

# Modern Eagle V

# Celebration of Tone

“Modern Eagle models have always been built to stand up to history while celebrating tonewoods and the discovery of new tones. The Modern Eagle V is a sophisticated instrument not only in its craftsmanship but in its electronic and mechanical design,” said Paul Reed Smith.

The Modern Eagle V offers highly musical tones for both recording and playing live. A mix of classic and modern, the Modern Eagle V is built on a tried-and-true foundation of a maple top and mahogany back, a 22 fret, 25” scale length, Pattern mahogany neck with rosewood fretboard, bone nut, PRS Phase III Tuners, and the PRS patented Gen III tremolo. Its innovative pickup and electronics configuration puts a wide range of tones at your fingertips.

Utilizing a hum/single/hum (five-coil) pickup layout and unique electronics configuration, the Modern Eagle V gives players a vast array of tones in one guitar. The 5-way blade switch selects the pickups in intuitive groupings: treble, treble and middle, middle, middle and bass, and bass. There is a single volume and a push/pull tone control that activates both humbuckers when engaged; this allows players to access all three pickups simultaneously. Finally, the dual EQ mini-toggle switches act as tuned high-pass filters when engaged (in the up position), removing shelved low-end and allowing the high frequencies through for more clarity and musical highs.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo, Gen III

Meticulous design delivering sonic fidelity, player ergonomics, and revolutionary tuning stability.

### PRS Phase III Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

Modern locking technology with vintage elegance, these lightweight tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS MEV Pickups

Versatile pickup configuration offering a vast array of tones in one guitar.

# DGT

# Vintage Tone Out Of The Box

“The DGT is a product a lot of miles down the road: a lot of gigs, a lot of records. It’s like picking up a vintage guitar. It sounds like a vintage guitar, and out of the box it’s ready to go. There’s a whole lot of thought gone into this. The DGT is pretty perfect to me.” – David Grissom

The DGT (David Grissom Trem) is the result of more than 20 years of collaboration between Paul Reed Smith and David Grissom. The DGT is based on the McCarty platform with a unique DGT neck shape, taller frets, specially-voiced pickups, and a revised control layout. Grissom and Paul spent a year A/B-ing more than forty sets of pickups before nailing the vintage-voice of DGT humbuckers. When paired with individual volume controls for each pickup and a push/pull master tone control that operates the coil taps, DGT pickups provide versatility and articulation.

An ultimate expression of a player’s guitar.

# Mark Tremonti Signature

# Aggressive, Articulate Tone

Mark Tremonti is one of rock’s leading guitarists. As the guitarist of Alter Bridge and Creed, he has met extraordinary success and continues to grow as both a guitar player and songwriter. While Creed was on tour in support of their first record, My Own Prison, Mark was contacted by PRS and asked if he would like to try one of their guitars.

"I jumped at the idea to play one of PRS’ guitars. PRS was one of those guitars that I could never afford in high school or college and had always wanted to play one." PRS sent Mark a McCarty model which he instantly fell in love with. He played that guitar exclusively for a while, but ultimately wanted a guitar that was more suited to his playing style.

Mark Tremonti began to collaborate with PRS on his dream guitar that would soon become the Mark Tremonti Signature. He needed pickups that were a little more aggressive and could complement his rhythm playing which contains a lot of palm muting. The neck of the guitar needed to accommodate his style, influenced by thrash metal, shred, and traditional blues. PRS met these needs with the Tremonti neck carve.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo, Gen III

Meticulous design delivering sonic fidelity, player ergonomics, and revolutionary tuning stability.

### PRS Phase III Locking Tuners

Modern locking technology with vintage elegance, these tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS Tremonti Pickups

# Santana Retro

# Celebrating History

Carlos Santana’s longstanding creative partnership with Paul Reed Smith has done much to shape the destiny of PRS Guitars. Over the years, we have honored this pivotal alliance by offering variations of his signature model instrument. The Santana Retro pays homage to the early “Pre-Factory” guitars Paul built for Carlos in the early 1980’s. Several unique design elements are reintroduced on this model, including a deeper body carve, original style heel, and the original headstock shape and nut placement. The Santana Retro blends history and modern manufacturing to create a highly musical guitar good enough for the man himself.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo, Gen III

Meticulous design delivering sonic fidelity, player ergonomics, and revolutionary tuning stability.

### PRS Phase III Locking Tuners

Modern locking technology with vintage elegance, these tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS Santana Pickups

Vintage-flavor pickups that deliver legendary clear, smooth tone.

# Chleo Limited Edition

# Unleash the Dragon

“With the PRS Chleo, I wanted to create a guitar that combined effortless playability, precision craftsmanship, and a versatile tonal range. It brings together modern innovation with timeless style, giving players the freedom to explore both classic sounds and new creative possibilities. The Chleo isn’t just a signature model — it’s a guitar built to inspire.” – Herman Li, DragonForce

Herman Li is an award-winning guitarist, songwriter, producer, and content creator, best known for his work as one of the lead guitar players in the power metal band DragonForce. As a guitar player who is as dedicated to understanding his instrument as he is to continually refining his craft as a player, Li was a formidable partner in designing his signature PRS. The initial result of this collaboration is the PRS Chleo Limited Edition, named by Li after his children. Only 200 of this instrument will be made in 2025.

At first glance, the Chleo is a seemingly dramatic departure from classic PRS design, but its craftsmanship and quality are wholly PRS. Featuring PRS’s tried-and-true combination of a mahogany back and figured maple top with a maple neck, the Chleo’s body shape and neck have been specially engineered for this model. The body has been modified in several ways from PRS’s traditional profile. Most notably, it is remarkably thin, making it light enough for high-energy stage performances and comfortable for longer gigs. The neck shape and neck joint were specially designed to be comfortable and fast, and with glow-in-the-dark side dots you’ll never lose your place. The neck is very thin front-to-back with a slightly taller playing surface and 20” fretboard radius, and the neck joint has added surface area to promote build integrity and tonal transfer. PRS’s trademark scoop has also been modified for ultimate access to the upper frets, and the last 4 frets are scalloped so you can dig into those notes with ease. If the Chleo wasn’t unmistakable already, its ebony fretboard features a unique “Eclipse Dragon” inlay pattern. Li’s Signature Series Fishman Fluence pickups are at the heart of the PRS Chleo. These copper-free pickups use layered PCBs for consistent, noise-free performance. With three distinct voices and a versatile switching system, the guitar offers up to 13 unique tone combinations. From fat, aggressive rhythm tones to smooth, warm leads, soaring screams, and crystal-clear single-coil sounds, these pickups cover it all. The performance-friendly control layout makes it easy to switch between tones on the fly. Whether you’re using high-gain tube amps, solid-state rigs, modern amp modelers, or DAW plugins, the Chleo’s pickups are built to shine across any setup. Adding to the innovation is a Gotoh locking tremolo system, enhanced with the new PRS Custom Stabilizer. It delivers the expressive freedom of a fully floating tremolo, while offering the tuning stability players love from fixed bridges, delivering confidence and control in any situation. Experience PRS quality in a boundary-pushing design with the PRS Chleo Limited Edition. PRS Chleo Limited Edition – Only 200 will be made in 2025.

These videos were created by our partners and friends. While many are not sponsored, some may feature paid partnerships. They all offer independent insights and reviews of our products.

## Featured Specifications

### Gotoh GE1996T Tremolo with PRS Stabilizer

This double-locking tremolo and PRS Custom Stabilizer combination means a fully floating bridge while maintaining exceptional tuning stability, even during aggressive tremolo use or string breakage. Expressive performance with reliable control.

### PRS Phase III Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

Modern locking technology with vintage elegance, these lightweight tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### Fishman Fluence Omniforce Pickups - Herman Li Signature

Featuring three distinct voices per pickup and a versatile switching system, the Omniforce set offers up to 13 tone combinations — from powerful high-output tones to articulate single-coil sounds. The middle single coil is designed to sit low against the body for improved picking comfort and tonal balance.

### PRS Chleo Ultimate Access Neck Joint

Reinforced neck joint with ultimate access to the upper frets works with any modern guitar techniques. Stress tested for stability and durability in the way only Herman Li can do. The last four frets are scalloped so you can dig in with ease.

# Charcoal Phoenix Limited Edition

# A Legacy Reborn

The PRS Charcoal Phoenix Limited Edition represents Paul Reed Smith’s current personal instrument choice as a guitar maker and a guitar player. Designed with meticulous attention to detail and crafted to celebrate PRS Guitars’ 40th Anniversary, this model is limited to only 150 pieces worldwide.

“When we released the Private Stock John McLaughlin Limited Edition in 2023, I was inspired by its exceptional sound and playability. For the Charcoal Phoenix, I wanted to create something equally remarkable but with a stoptail bridge. Using chaltecoco for the neck and ziricote for the fingerboard, I achieved an instrument that sustains beautifully and rings with clarity. The deep crimson back and the charcoal microburst top inspired the name ‘Charcoal Phoenix,’ evoking the imagery of a phoenix rising from fire and ashes.” – Paul Reed Smith

Over the past year, Paul has road-tested this guitar, refining its design and tone. The result is an instrument that delivers aesthetic arrest and unparalleled performance. A visually stunning deep crimson back contrasts beautifully with the Private Stock-grade figured maple top in a charcoal microburst finish. The ripple abalone “Old School” bird inlays on the ziricote fingerboard add a touch of vintage elegance. The Charcoal Phoenix also features the newly updated PRS TCI pickups for 2025 and EQ mini-toggle switches. The TCI pickups are crafted with American Alnico magnets and slightly modified winding, wiring, and electronics specifications. These pickups have a clear, beautiful tone based on Paul’s experience playing this guitar live and in the studio for more than a year. The EQ mini-toggles act as tuned high-pass filters when engaged, removing shelved low end and allowing the high frequencies through for more clarity and musical highs.

Introduced on Paul Reed Smith’s birthday, the PRS Charcoal Phoenix Limited Edition is part of PRS Guitars 40th Anniversary celebration. Only 150 of these instruments will be available. Hand-signed 40th Anniversary certificate included.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Stoptail w/ Brass Inserts & Steel Studs

Engineered with curved string slots with brass inserts and steel studs, this bridge is designed to maximize the transfer of the strings’ vibrations through the instrument.

### PRS Phase III Non-Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

With vintage elegance, these lightweight tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS TCI Pickups

Musical pickups that offer versatile tones from spanky single coils to full soapbars. Made with American Alnico in Stevensville, Maryland.

# CE 24

# Addictive Bolt-on Tone & Feel

Since the dawn of rock and roll, the snap and response that comes from a bolt-on neck guitar has been an essential part of the mix. These attributes have, in turn, become essential to many players trying to tell their story through music. The CE 24 pairs PRS’s traditional body combination of the mahogany back and maple top with a bolt-on maple neck and rosewood fretboard. The neck sports a Pattern Thin carve and satin nitro finish for a natural, addictive feel.

To further maximize the guitar’s inherent tone and clarity, the CE 24 features PRS 85/15 pickups, which were designed to have clarity across their extended high and low end frequencies. The electronics consist of a volume and push/pull tone control with 3-way toggle switch for a total of six classic sounds.

The PRS CE 24 now comes with PRS Phase III tuners, featuring a handsome open-back design, unplated brass shafts, and highly-usable gear ratio.

The original CE was introduced in 1988 and offered players PRS design and quality with the added snap and sparkle of traditional bolt-on guitars.

## Accolades

"Ultimately, the CE 24 begs for a test drive, especially by skeptics. This isn’t the first PRS that’s forged a bridge between differing solidbody designs, but it’s also its own animal – a serious professional instrument that can cover all the bases...a formidable piece of American guitar-making.”

- Vintage Guitar

"...there’s a character here that leans just a little towards a good Fender, a percussive edge or subtle flavor that is what attracted so many of us to those original CEs..."

- Guitarist

"If you're looking for something a little different but still want a high-quality US-built guitar with a lot of versatility, excellent ergonomics and playability and great looks too, but want it all at a reasonably realistic price that's low enough that you'll actually use the guitar instead of putting it into a glass case and just staring at it, check out the return of the Paul Reed Smith CE 24."

- Harmony Central

"Sonically, the CE 24 hit all of the marks...Exploring all the options would probably have taken me days (or weeks), and I doubt I’d find a tone that the CE 24 couldn’t emulate effectively.”

- Guitar Player

"If I were the type to limit myself to just one guitar (hint: I’m not), I could easily do an entire gig with just the CE24 running from classic rock, to indie rock, to alt-country, and on."

- Tone Report

“If you are on the hunt for endless tone options and value beautiful design, look no further; the CE 24 might just be your new favorite axe.”

- She Shreds

"The CE24 was a total game changer for me. Its sleek design allows me to reach every note and chord with ease, while the 85/15 pickups allow me to truly express the tone I'm after whether it's clean or crunchy."

- Dylan Bowman, I Prevail

# CE 24 Semi-Hollow

# Classic CE Character with Semi-Hollow Style

Combining the snap and sustain of a bolt-on guitar with the airy resonance of a semi-hollow body, the CE 24 Semi-Hollow is a truly unique instrument in the PRS Bolt-On lineup. The body pairs the traditional combination of a mahogany back and maple top with a bolt-on maple neck and rosewood fretboard. The neck features a Pattern Thin carve and satin nitro finish for a natural, addictive feel.

The CE 24 Semi-Hollow boasts PRS 85/15 pickups, which were designed to have clarity across their extended high- and low-end frequencies. The electronics consist of a volume and push/pull tone control with a 3-way toggle switch, giving a total of six classic sounds from the PRS 85/15 pickups.

# NF 53

“I am so pleased with the feedback from the artists who have played this guitar – everyone is telling us that we have something special here. If you are a fan of this style and tone, the NF 53 will take you where you want to go. To me, to have this kind of beautiful high end without the hum is game changing.” – Paul Reed Smith

The PRS NF 53 is a powerful guitar that combines classic tones with modern design. Inspired by one of Paul Reed Smith’s vintage guitars from 1953, the PRS NF 53 combines a swamp ash body and 22-fret, 25.5” scale length bolt-on maple neck with maple fretboard with a special set of PRS Narrowfield pickups. PRS Narrowfield DD (Deep Dish) pickups are made with taller bobbins to fit more winds and extra metal pieces in between the magnets for a more focused, powerful tone.

Paired with a volume and tone control and 3-way blade pickup switch, the NF 53 allows players to easily dial in their sound. The steel plate-style bridge, bone nut, and PRS Phase III tuners with unplated brass shafts all work together to provide precise and reliable tuning stability while promoting sustain and powerful tone.

Whether you are a seasoned player or just starting out, the PRS NF 53 is an addictive guitar you won’t want to put down.

## Accolades

“Having been a huge fan of PRS for many years, I was ecstatic to hear about the NF53 model. Once I got my hands on it, it quickly became my favorite guitar I have ever played. The playability, per PRS standards, is second to none and I’ve never encountered a more versatile instrument. It has everything I could ever need or want from an electric guitar. Twangy and beefy…smooth and crystal clear: the NF 53 is a total game changer! PRS have knocked it out of the park yet again!”

- Trey Hensley

“The NF 53 can scream, twang, or sing with subtlety. It’s responsive and touch sensitive—the notes are simply jumping out of this thing. On the stage and in the studio, getting single coil tones with zero hum thanks to the Narrowfield pickups is a game changer. The neck is the perfect amount of chunk. It can more than handle any gig and it’s just a blast to play.”

- Rick Lollar

“As a professional musician, I have played countless guitars over the years. From the moment I picked up the new NF53, I knew I was holding something special. The body pays tribute to the classic Telecaster design but with modern contours that make it more comfortable. The neck is smooth, comfortable, and the playability is exceptional. The pickups deliver a modern, punchy tone that's perfect for rock, blues or jazz, but it still retains that classic Tele twang. I can’t recommend the NF53 enough. It’s a top-quality instrument that's perfect for any serious musician.”

- Mike Seal

“Absolutely blown away! As a huge fan of T style guitars, this checks all the boxes. It can twang, it can rock - I’d take this on any gig that got thrown my way knowing I could cover tons of ground with it. As I’ve come to expect from every PRS - exceptional fit and finish and plays like a dream!”

- Seth Rosenbloom

“The new PRS NF 53 is as fun to play as it is to look at. A modern take on a classic. The feel of this guitar is as comfortable as I’ve come to expect from PRS and the tone is warm, woody and articulate. It has immediately found a home in my arsenal as a go to guitar and I have no reason to believe that will change anytime soon!”

- Kevin Arrowsmith, Luke Bryan

"What more need be said: the NF53 simply blew me away…and continues to every time I plug in! This is an exciting chapter in the PRS story and one you need to check out! Congratulations to Paul and staff - well done!

- Dan Weller, Tyler Hubbard

# Myles Kennedy

Introducing Myles Kennedy’s first signature model. Known for his work in Alter Bridge, Slash and the Conspirators, and his own solo recordings, Kennedy is an accomplished guitarist who brings blues and jazz style to rock guitar playing. This new signature model mirrors Kennedy’s rock sensibilities with a nod to historic designs. While the aesthetic may have players hearing chicken pickin’ in their heads – and this guitar can certainly reach twang territory – it is made to play like a rock machine.

“This guitar captures the spirit of my favorite older instruments. With that said, since we developed this guitar, most of my vintage instruments rarely see the light of day,” said Kennedy.

The PRS Myles Kennedy signature guitar features a swamp ash body, a 22-fret, 25.5” scale length maple neck with maple fretboard, and two PRS Narrowfield MK pickups. The PRS Narrowfield MK pickups were carefully voiced to capture the courage of humbuckers and the spank of single coils. PRS Narrowfields provided the perfect starting point for this design, with their ability to deliver thick single-coil sounds without the hum. These pickups are paired with a 5-way blade switch and a push/pull tone control that acts as a preset tone roll- off, bringing down the higher frequencies on the treble pickup so you can dig in to the fullest.

“I watched Myles throughout his career alternate between humbucking and single coil sounds without giving anything up on either side. These pickups took us months to dial in, and I think they capture that balance that Myles mastered beautifully,” said Paul Reed Smith.

Other features include a PRS plate-style steel bridge, vintage-style locking tuners, bone nut, and Kennedy’s “Geometric Owl” logo from his “Ides of March” solo release, representing wisdom and adaptability.

“I feel like we managed to touch on the elusive quality that makes you want to play with this guitar. It beckons you to take it off the wall or out of the case and make music.” – Myles Kennedy

# Swamp Ash Special

# Fresh Face and a Versatile Voice

The PRS Swamp Ash Special brings a unique look and sound to the PRS Bolt-On line up. Its swamp ash body is equipped with a versatile hum/“single”/hum pickup configuration. Two 58/15 LT pickups flank a PRS Narrowfield in the middle position, which adds a single-coil bite – without the hum. Paired with a volume, tone, 5-way blade switch, and dual mini-toggle coil-tap switches (for the first time on this model), the Swamp Ash Special has a total of twelve sound combinations. Roll back the tone control for added growl, turn it up for some shimmer, and have fun exploring this versatile tonal palette.

The volume level between the humbucking and single-coil settings will remain even through it all. Additional specifications for the Swamp Ash Special include a 22-fret 25” scale length maple neck, rosewood fretboard, Phase III locking tuners with unplated brass shafts, and the PRS Patented tremolo.

Overall, the PRS Swamp Ash Special offers tight low-end, bright but mellow high-end, and a welcome twangy tone that can reach “hot country,” blues, and jazz territory. It is a versatile guitar to add to any arsenal.

This model is also available with a maple fretboard. To explore that offering, please click here.

# Silver Sky Maple

# Reach For The Sky

“It’s been a dream of mine for years to design a guitar that includes some of my favorite vintage specifications but with a modern spirit and aesthetic. After two years of study and refinement, the Silver Sky is my vision of what a reboot of the electric guitar should look and feel like.” – John Mayer

The PRS Silver Sky is an idealized version of a vintage single-coil guitar where every detail adds up and sets this guitar apart from the pack and the past. The result of a close collaboration between Grammy Award-winning musician John Mayer and Paul Reed Smith, the Silver Sky is based off of years of development. Incorporating Mayer and Smith’s favorite elements of 1963 and 1964 instruments with an eye toward modern references, the PRS Silver Sky delivers the warmth and familiarity of an old guitar with the finesse of a brand-new instrument.

Some of the more distinctive specifications include, the headstock shape, tuners, bridge, pickups, and neck and fretboard options. The headstock shape is based on PRS’s trademark design, but inverted both to accommodate Mayer’s playing style and also to keep a consistent length of string behind the nut, which makes staying in tune easier. The tuners are a traditional vintage-style, closed-back tuner, but with PRS’s locking design. The steel tremolo takes the patented PRS design and incorporates Gen III knife-edge screws. Setup flush to the body in the neutral position so that the tremolo bridge only goes down in pitch, the bridge’s increased contact with the body allows the guitar itself to be acoustically louder, which in turn improves the signal to noise ratio of the single-coil pickups. The 635JM single-coil pickups are very round and full, with a musical high end that is never “ice-picky” or brash.

The Silver Sky comes with the option of a rosewood or maple fretboard. The maple fretboard option comes with the original 635JM neck shape, while the rosewood fretboard option has been subtly modified in the shoulders to feel more “rounded” in your hand. Both neck shapes were designed by researching vintage instruments and Mayer test-driving guitars on stage to find what felt right. The fretboard radius on both options is 7.25”.

Other high-quality specifications include a bone nut, a molded metal jack plate (curved to make plugging and unplugging a guitar cable hassle-free), retooled knobs, and PRS’s double action truss rod (accessible from the front of the headstock for ease of use). PRS premium gig bag included.

This model is also available with a rosewood fretboard. To explore that offering, please click here.

## Accolades

- Premier Guitar

“[The PRS Silver Sky] offers up shockingly good vintage tones and feel, but modern production methods and PRS’s legendary attention to detail have eliminated all the problems that go along with vintage instruments…including the monstrous price tag!”

- Guitar Interactive

“Tonally, it’s big, clear, and airy when played clean, and fat and resonant with overdrive kicked on…There’s so much to dig with this guitar, but most are sure to keep going back to that heel and amazing upper-fret reach, which changes everything.”

- Vintage Guitar

“After playing the Silver Sky, it’s easy to understand why it took so long to design and why John Mayer embraced this endeavor. For aficionados of the classic three single-coil pickup solidbody guitar design, this is truly one of the finest examples ever produced.”

- Guitar World

“A superb vintage and experience-informed three single-coil bolt-on. Build playability, sound and typical PRS attention to detail and quality.”

- Music Radar

"Bottom line: The Silver Sky absolutely delivers on the promise of being a damn-near-perfect version of this type of guitar…Paul Reed Smith doesn’t mess around, and you’ve got to assume that he never would have made this guitar if he didn’t think he could bring something inspiring to the party.”

- Guitar Player

“This is not simply a Strat with a PRS headstock. As Paul Reed Smith pointed out in an interview, every aspect of the guitar was thoughtfully designed, or redesigned. But don’t just take our word for it. Try one out. You may be just as impressed as we are.”

- MusicPlayers.com

"This guitar isn't designed to be just a collector's item that is hung on a wall to look at, it was built to be played and pushed to the limit."

- Maverick Magazine

“You can take as many modern or vintage twists as you want on an instrument. The real question is: does it work on stage or in the studio? Silver Sky works.”

- Clay Cook, Zac Brown Band

“Man I am hooked on this Silver Sky. Can’t stop playing it! The feel and dynamics are really next level.”

- Eric Krasno

“The Silver Sky is the closest anyone has ever come to bettering Leo's original blueprint for the Stratocaster.”

# Fiore

# Play in Full Bloom

“All guitarists have a sound in their head – a sound that evolves and grows as they progress, discovering all of the beautiful idiosyncrasies that define their individual voice. To facilitate this process, players need a vibrant, dynamic guitar that becomes a free space in which their personality can unfold. PRS and I designed Fiore (Italian for ‘flower’) to be this guitar.” – Mark Lettieri

The PRS Fiore model continues PRS Guitars’ journey into the bolt-on, single-coil guitar world. Developed with guitarist, composer, producer, and instructor Mark Lettieri, the PRS Fiore offers a modern aesthetic, effortless playability, and an addictive and sophisticated tonal canvas.

The PRS Fiore pickups were carefully voiced by Lettieri and PRS to allow players a platform to explore and find their voice. The Fiore-S single coil offers exceptional malleability in tone. Capable of capturing all the articulation found in everything from whisper-quiet melodies to full on funk and rock explosivity, this pickup reacts to each player's unique approach.

The Fiore-H humbucker fulfills Lettieri’s desire for extensive versatility in the treble position: enough power and punch for high-gain lead tones, but with a smooth top end that allows the pickup to be played clean, even with the volume knob wide open. Both the Fiore-S and -H pickups work seamlessly together, producing balance, clarity, and that elusive ‘bloom’ in all five positions.

But the tone exploration doesn’t stop there. The Fiore model features a 5-way blade switch with traditional wiring (bridge / bridge + middle / middle / middle + neck / neck). The Fiore also features a single volume and two push/pull tone controls, which further adds to this guitar’s tone-shaping abilities.

Lettieri brought several personal design choices to this model, including a custom truss rod cover drawn by his very own mom. Other appointments include a Swamp Ash body, 22 fret maple neck with maple fretboard, and 25.5” scale length for classic look and feel.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS 2-Point Steel Tremolo

Comfortable tremolo functionality with exceptional tuning stability, featuring a classic 2-point mounting system.

### Vintage-Style, Locking Tuners

# Fiore HH

# Double Hum Power

“For players who love the specifications and versatility of the original Fiore but whose sound revolves more around humbuckers, this is the guitar for you.” — Mark Lettieri

Developed with guitarist, composer, producer, and instructor Mark Lettieri, the PRS Fiore HH offers another tonal platform for players searching for vibrancy, dynamics, balance, and clarity. With a swamp ash body, 25.5” scale length maple neck, 22-fret rosewood fretboard, and 2-point steel tremolo, the PRS Fiore HH keeps the original Fiore’s modern aesthetic and effortless playability. Where the Fiore HH diverges from the original model is with its dual humbucker setup.

The Fiore-H humbuckers have enough power and punch for high-gain lead tones but with a smooth top end that allows the pickup to be played clean, even with the volume knob wide open. By pairing these pickups with a master volume, two push/pull tone knobs, and 3-way blade switch, the Fiore HH brings exciting voicing options to players. Each tone control acts as an individual series/parallel selector for each pickup. When in series, you get the full humbucker sound - warm full lows and mids and an articulate top end. When in parallel, the pickups take on more of a single coil sparkle with a slightly scooped feel and more brilliance. In all, players can explore eight tonal combinations.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS 2-Point Steel Tremolo

Comfortable tremolo functionality with exceptional tuning stability, featuring a classic 2-point mounting system.

### Vintage-Style Locking Tuners

Traditional vintage style, closed back tuners outfitted with PRS’s locking system.

### Hum/Hum Pickups

Full humbucker sound: warm full lows and mids, and an articulate top end. Pull up on the tone knob to put the pickups in parallel and they take on more single coil sparkle with a slightly scooped feel and more brilliance.

# Fiore HH Satin

# Double Hum Power

“For players who love the specifications and versatility of the original Fiore but whose sound revolves more around humbuckers, this is the guitar for you.” — Mark Lettieri

Developed with guitarist, composer, producer, and instructor Mark Lettieri, the PRS Fiore HH offers another tonal platform for players searching for vibrancy, dynamics, balance, and clarity. With a swamp ash body, 25.5” scale length maple neck, 22-fret rosewood fretboard, and 2-point steel tremolo, the PRS Fiore HH keeps the original Fiore’s modern aesthetic and effortless playability. Where the Fiore HH diverges from the original model is with its dual humbucker setup.

The Fiore-H humbuckers have enough power and punch for high-gain lead tones but with a smooth top end that allows the pickup to be played clean, even with the volume knob wide open. By pairing these pickups with a master volume, two push/pull tone knobs, and 3-way blade switch, the Fiore HH brings exciting voicing options to players. Each tone control acts as an individual series/parallel selector for each pickup. When in series, you get the full humbucker sound - warm full lows and mids and an articulate top end. When in parallel, the pickups take on more of a single coil sparkle with a slightly scooped feel and more brilliance. In all, players can explore eight tonal combinations.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS 2-Point Steel Tremolo

Comfortable tremolo functionality with exceptional tuning stability, featuring a classic 2-point mounting system.

### Vintage-Style Locking Tuners

Traditional vintage style, closed back tuners outfitted with PRS’s locking system.

### Hum/Hum Pickups

Full humbucker sound: warm full lows and mids, and an articulate top end. Pull up on the tone knob to put the pickups in parallel and they take on more single coil sparkle with a slightly scooped feel and more brilliance.

# S2 Custom 24

# A Classic Reimagined

The Custom 24 is the original PRS. Since its introduction, it has offered a unique option for serious players and defined PRS tone and playability. The S2 Custom 24 takes the original PRS guitar, the Custom 24, and re-imagines it with stripped-down features and a new aesthetic.

Retaining the classic maple top/mahogany back combination with our classic body shape and an asymmetrical beveled top, this guitar has a resonant, powerful voice. Its versatility comes from its Maryland, USA-wound PRS 85/15 pickups and 5-way blade switch, offering all the same sounds as the flagship Custom 24. The PRS S2 Custom 24 now comes with PRS Phase III tuners, featuring a handsome open-back design, unplated brass shafts, and highly-usable gear ratio. Familiar for PRS players of old, and a fresh take for players of all types.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo

Patented design, delivering tonal fidelity, player comfort, and tuning stability.

### PRS Phase III Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

Modern locking technology with vintage elegance, these lightweight tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS 85/15 Pickups

Uncovered pickups with remarkable clarity and extended high and low end, perfect for more modern applications.

## Accolades

"From the second I plugged in the PRS Custom 24, I felt as if I've never had so much power being a guitarist. Its original unique sound is unmatched by any other guitar on the market!!! It has the most full tone of any guitar ever, and that's just stock. I now consider it as an extension of my body... Hell, I even sleep with the thing... (TRUTH)”

- Bryce Klemer, Pacific Dub

"When you're on the road every day, it takes a toll on your gear. These guitars are by far the best I have used PERIOD! Day in day out my S2 Custom 24 performs as it should. I beat this thing to death, literally, and it still stays in tune and sounds amazing!”

- David Whitaker, Another Lost Year

"Personally, with our style of music and our live show, the weight and feel of my S2 Custom 24 is the perfect guitar for me. Absolutely the best guitar I've ever owned, amazing tone, and takes a beating, you'll have to pry it out of my hands, and I hold on for life.”

- Clinton Cunanan, Another Lost Year

"My S2 is my work horse, both live and in the studio. It's got the tonal versatility which sets PRS apart, and the quality of workmanship which means it effortlessly withstands the sweat and the knocks of our live show. I wouldn't be without it anywhere.”

- Simon Delaney, Don Broco

# S2 Custom 24-08

# Gig-Ready Versatility

The S2 Custom 24-08 shares many of the same specifications as the S2 Custom 24 but adds a new level of versatility with its intuitive switching system. Platform specifications for this guitar include a maple top, mahogany back and neck, and rosewood fretboard with bird inlays. It boasts 24 frets, a 25” scale length Pattern Thin neck, PRS’s Patented Gen III Tremolo, and Phase III Tuners with unplated brass shafts and wing buttons.

The Maryland, USA-made PRS TCI pickups deliver full, single-coil tones reminiscent of vintage soapbars. The pickups are paired with a 3-way toggle switch and two mini-toggle EQ switches. The dual EQ mini-toggle switches act as tuned high-pass filters when engaged (in the up position), removing shelved low-end and allowing the high frequencies through for more clarity and musical highs.

For classic PRS feel with expanded flexibility, check out the PRS S2 Custom 24-08.

# S2 Standard 22

# All-Mahogany Workhorse

The PRS S2 Standard 22 is an all-mahogany workhorse guitar for gigging musicians. With vintage sweetness, warmth, and full tone, the S2 Standard 22 excels both plugged straight into an amp and with a modern pedalboard.

The S2 Standard 22’s solid mahogany body and set neck give this guitar a distinctive resonance and powerful sustain, and when mahogany’s rich, round tone meets the Maryland, USA-made PRS 58/15 LT pickups, there are plenty of clear highs and strong mids to be dialed in. Accentuate your playing without going out of tune with the PRS patented tremolo, and explore an array of tones with the 5-way blade pickup switch.

For the first-time player or the serious musician who wants to cover a lot of ground with their music, the S2 Standard 22 is a perfect choice.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Phase III Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

- Interactive Guitar Magazine

"Flexible all-round guitar for advanced and professionals who put their focus on less pompous appearance, but more to a rich tone and want spending less money properly.” (review link - review in German)

# S2 Standard 24

# Bold. Classic. Gig Ready.

With its solid build and versatile electronics platform, the S2 Standard 24 is a true player’s guitar that handles as well as it sounds whether plugged straight into your amp or run through your pedal board. The subtle aesthetic of mahogany and vintage vibe of pickguard-mounted electronics give the S2 Standard 24 an understated look for players who prefer a stripped-down approach to their music.

The S2 Standard 24’s solid mahogany body and set neck give this guitar a distinctive resonance and powerful sustain, and when mahogany’s rich, round, warm tone meets the Maryland, USA-made PRS 58/15 LT pickups, there are plenty of clear highs and strong mids to be dialed in. The original PRS Standard, introduced in 1987, evolved from Paul Smith’s pre-factory all-mahogany guitars. Reimagined here for the S2 Series, the Standard 24 is gig-ready with a price tag to match.

# S2 Standard 22 Satin

# Bare-Bones Workhorse

The PRS S2 Standard 22 Satin is a workhorse guitar for gigging musicians. With an all-mahogany body and 22-fret set mahogany neck, this guitar is warm and sweet, making it toneful enough to stand up plugged straight into an amplifier and solid enough to serve as a great platform for even the most modern pedal board set up. The S2 Standard 22’s thin satin nitro finish gives this instrument a wonderful resonance and an open clarity, and when mahogany’s rich, round, warm tone meets the Maryland, USA-made PRS 58/15 LT pickups, there are plenty of clear highs and strong mids to be dialed in.

The PRS S2 Standard 22 Satin is outfitted with the PRS patented tremolo and PRS Phase III tuners, featuring a handsome open-back design, unplated brass shafts, and highly-usable gear ratio. For the player who wants to cover a lot of ground with their music, the S2 Standard 22 Satin is a perfect choice.

# S2 Vela

# Offset Design with Unforgettable Tone

Anchored by PRS playability and craftsmanship, the S2 Vela is perfect for players who want PRS build quality and reliability with a fresh aesthetic. The Vela represents the maiden voyage into an offset body shape for PRS and is both elegant and distinctive.

Loaded with a PRS DS-01 humbucker in the treble pickup position and the PRS Narrowfield in the bass pickup position, the Vela has a bright, punchy tone that sounds great plugged into your pedalboard or straight into an amp. A coil-tap on the tone control allows the DS-01 pickup to split into single coils and explore a whole new range of tones.

The PRS plate-style bridge features two brass saddles specifically designed for great sustain and perfect intonation so both rhythm and lead tones sound great no matter where you are on the fretboard. In the studio or on the stage, you won’t want to leave this guitar at home.

## Accolades

"If you’ve previously balked at trying a PRS because you’d didn’t dig the styling, this beautiful machine—and its beautiful tones—might flip that notion on its head.”

- Premier Guitar

"If the Vela had been made in the 1950's, it would be considered as classic as the Stratocaster. It's a natural guitar with a wonderful personality!”

- Walker Teret, Lower Dens

“PRS guitars are made with love and you can feel it when you play them. They are also made with an incredible understanding of what makes a guitar great. The Vela is a great rock guitar. It can do scuzz, fuzz, psych, punk, whatever you want and it also can scream some insane leads. I can’t get enough of this axe!”

- Michael Gibbons, Bardo Pond

“The Vela nails all of the vintage tones I've become accustomed to using in the studio, and has become my go to live because of its stable intonation, tuning, and playability.”

- Thomas Onebane, Royal Teeth

“I think the PRS team has hit a home run with the Vela. In terms of quality and tone at this price point, I don’t think anyone else is making anything remotely close.”

- Jordan Smith, Diarrhea Planet

“Overall, the PRS S2 Vela is a great guitar at a great price point. This is the perfect jack-of-all-trades guitar and is one that will presumably last for many years to come.”

- Crafted

"PRS have really created something important with the S2 range. Every guitar I’ve played has shown the thought, care and (yes) love that the company has thrown at the project. But the Vela may be the best yet. It is beautifully made, has a huge tonal range and sounds and feels lovely.”

- Guitar In Your Pocket

“This is SWEET. The feel and sound transcend what a guitar can be. The Vela has soul, it’s alive and part of something greater than you can imagine. It sounds so nice and is so beautiful. The Paul Reed Smith Vela, It’s a dream.”

- John Gibbons, Bardo Pond

“I've always been a bridge pickup guy and a sucker for big, bright, punchy guitar tones. I knew this guitar would be great for clean studio playing, but I was really pleasantly surprised by how well the Starla pickup worked for driving power-pop and punky, angular playing -- The tone is bright and punchy, but never too thin. The coil tap control is a neat function too, opening up an equally great tone with a little more chime to it. I can tell I'll be using this guitar for years to come in a variety of different projects.”

- Tommy Siegel, Jukebox The Ghost

A really broad range of sounds can be had from this guitar using the tone control, the three-way toggle selector and the coil split, especially if one were to run it through a larger amp with some tonal options and a pedal or two.”

- American Songwriter

“While it’s probably shocking to the PRS purists, I’m a sucker for offset guitars and the Vela design won me over instantly.”

- Tone Report

“With its versatile variety of tones, first-class craftsmanship and construction, and incredibly comfortable playability, the PRS S2 Vela is a new classic that will be embraced by discriminating players looking for something a little different.”

# S2 Vela Satin

# Simply Irresistible

The S2 Vela Satin is a vintage-inspired guitar with loads of personality and tonal textures. The Vela boasts a contemporary offset body shape, and the addition of a thin, satin nitro finish provides added resonance and a truly addictive feel.

Its pickguard-loaded electronics feature a PRS DS-01 pickup in the treble pickup position, providing a bright, punky tone, while the PRS Narrowfield in the bass pickup position gives the Vela some noteworthy bite. The coil-tap on the tone control allows the treble pickup to split to single coils, providing additional tonal versatility.

Anchoring this guitar is the PRS plate-style bridge with two saddles that were designed to compensate for intonation. This bridge harkens back to Paul’s early designs and traditional bass plate-style bridges but is top-loading for easy restringing. Like the bridge found on Paul’s Guitar and some Private Stock models, PRS’s plate-style bridge features brass saddles and a steel plate for maximum tone.

# S2 Vela Semi-Hollow

# Offset Semi-Hollow, Full of Character

The S2 Vela Semi-Hollow is a vintage-inspired guitar with loads of personality and tonal textures. Its offset body shape is at once elegant and distinctive, and the all-mahogany design delivers warm, organic tone. The addition of semi-hollow construction and f-hole gives the Vela added resonance.

The pickguard-loaded electronics feature a PRS DS-01 pickup in the treble pickup position, providing a bright, chimey tone, and the PRS Narrowfield in the bass pickup position gives the Vela some noteworthy bite. The coil-tap on the tone control allows the treble pickup to split to single coils, providing even more tonal versatility.

Anchoring this guitar is the PRS plate-style bridge with two saddles that were designed to compensate for intonation. This bridge harkens back to Paul’s early designs and traditional bass plate-style bridges, but is top-loading for easy restringing.

# S2 Vela Semi-Hollow Satin

# Offset Semi-Hollow That’s Full of Character

The S2 Vela Semi-Hollow Satin is a vintage-inspired, offset guitar with loads of personality and tonal textures. The all-mahogany body brings warmth and an organic tone, while the semi-hollow construction and thin, satin nitro finish give the Vela resonance and bloom.

The pickguard-loaded electronics feature a PRS DS-01 pickup in the treble pickup position, providing a bright, punky tone, while the PRS Narrowfield in the bass pickup position gives the Vela some noteworthy bite. The coil-tap on the tone control allows the treble pickup to split to single coils, providing even more tonal versatility.

Anchoring this guitar is the PRS plate-style bridge with two saddles that were designed to compensate for intonation. This bridge harkens back to Paul’s early designs and traditional bass plate-style bridges but is top-loading for easy restringing. Like the bridge found on Paul’s Guitar and some Private Stock models, PRS’s plate-style bridge features brass saddles and a steel plate for maximum tonal sustain.

## Featured Specifications

### Plate-Style Bridge

Our steel plate-style bridge is easy to string, comfortable, fully-intonating and it sounds great.

### PRS Phase III Non-Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

With vintage elegance, these lightweight tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS DS-01 & Narrowfield

A lively pickup combination that provides full midrange and articulate, chimey high-end.

# S2 Special Semi-Hollow Reclaimed Limited Edition

# Tell a New Story

“It is impossible to fool a good guitar player. Everyone who has a guitar made from these woods sees them as a legitimate tool for serious players, not as a gimmick.” – Michael Reid, PRS Guitars Senior Wood Buyer

This 700-piece limited edition showcases reclaimed and salvaged woods on one of our most versatile models: the S2 Special Semi-Hollow. With each top boasting its own character and left as natural as possible, every instrument is rendered unique. That character paired with a wide spectrum of tones – from articulate single-coil sparkle to full, vintage-inspired humbucking warmth – results in a truly special instrument.

The woods featured on this model include a Peroba Rosa top, Cuban mahogany neck, and Guaribu fretboard. Peroba Rosa, typically used as siding in Brazil, was selected for the top wood. The density of this 100-150 year old wood combined with the semi-hollow body construction gives the S2 Special Semi-Hollow Reclaimed Limited Edition a unique sound that is punchy but also warm and full. The Cuban mahogany used for the necks was purchased from Puerto Rico; some of this wood was salvaged from trees blown down by Hurricane Maria in 2017. Finally, the Guaribu Preto fretboards are sourced from Brazil, where this wood was historically used as support beams for houses. These guitars are left Natural in color and finished in satin nitro. Any nail holes, wear, or discoloration have been left in the top wood to showcase its history.

“Wood is a crucial element to our guitar making heritage. Michael Reid, our Senior Wood Buyer, has been my curly maple wood provider and buyer since 1980 - before PRS was officially PRS - and we still work together as partners today. The deep relationships Michael has formed worldwide with our wood suppliers are remarkable. Guitars like this are a great way to highlight some of the interesting, personal stories from his travels and musical wood understanding,” said Paul Reed Smith.

You can read more from Michael on our blog.

Beyond their unique wood appointments, these instruments maintain many of the S2 Special Semi-Hollow’s standard specifications, including a 22-fret, 25” scale length Pattern Regular neck and hum/Narrowfield/hum pickup configuration. A 5-way blade switch and two mini-toggles allow players to tap the humbuckers, creating twelve distinct pickup combinations and ensuring endless sonic exploration.

Only 700 S2 Special Semi-Hollow Reclaimed Limited Edition guitars will be made in 2025.

# SE Custom 24

# Professional Quality. Classic PRS Design.

The SE Custom 24 brings the original PRS design platform to the high-quality, more affordable SE Series of instruments. Played by internationally touring artists, gigging musicians, and aspiring players, the SE Custom 24 is a modern classic with roadworthy durability, addictive playability, and wide array of tones.

Featuring a maple top, mahogany back, wide thin maple neck, rosewood fretboard with bird inlays, and the PRS patented tremolo, the PRS SE Custom 24 boasts many familiar appointments. Its versatile sounds come from the 85/15 “S” pickups paired with a volume, push/pull tone control, and 3-way blade pickup selector. Now with ergonomic lampshade knobs and PRS's flat-grip switch tip design, the PRS SE Custom 24 is more performance-ready than ever.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo

Patented design, delivering tonal fidelity, player comfort, and tuning stability.

### PRS-Designed Tuners

Designed to PRS's specifications, these lightweight tuners provide precise tuning and won't dampen your tone.

### PRS 85/15 “S”

Uncovered pickups designed to PRS’s specifications with clarity and extended high and low end – perfect for modern applications.

## Accolades

These [SE Custom 24 & SE Custom 24-08] are inherently versatile designs that will cover a wide range of styles. The vintage-hot voice of their pickups is a great place to start, but once you factor in those switching options these both reveal themselves as Swiss Army Knife six-strings.

# SE Custom 24-08

# Expanded Sonic Territory

The Custom 24 is the quintessential PRS guitar: the iconic guitar that started it all back in 1985. The Custom 24-08 keeps all the foundational specs of the instrument, while taking the Custom platform to new sonic territories. Like the Core Series instrument, the SE Custom 24-08 features two mini-toggle coil-tap switches that individually tap the humbuckers for single coil sounds and a total of eight pickup configurations.

Classic design elements include a maple top, mahogany back, rosewood fretboard, 24 frets, 25” scale length, bird inlays, signature headstock logo, and PRS patented tremolo.

## Accolades

For a sub-$1000 price point, you really get your money's worth when it comes to action, fit, & finish. This guitar, especially in the Eriza Verde finish, is stunning from top to bottom…I'd be hard-pressed to pick anything over this if you told me I need to grab a guitar and play a handful of styles and genres on stage tonight. PRS has done a great job with this one, and the SE Custom 24-08 is another premium addition to their affordable lines.

- UltimateGuitar.com

These [SE Custom 24 & SE Custom 24-08] are inherently versatile designs that will cover a wide range of styles. The vintage-hot voice of their pickups is a great place to start, but once you factor in those switching options these both reveal themselves as Swiss Army Knife six-strings.

- Music Radar

“Many times, when multiple options are available with pickups, one or two just don’t really make sense. Not here; we found the single coil tones very sweet and still maintained unity gain and didn’t require any fussing with boosting the signal in other ways to still be heard or cut through…Overall, it’s a practical and giggable instrument right out of the box.”

# SE Custom 24 Semi-Hollow Piezo

# Electric and Acoustic Tones

The PRS SE Custom 24 Semi-Hollow Piezo is a highly sophisticated and incredibly versatile instrument. The Custom 24 is the original design first introduced by PRS in 1985 as a solidbody guitar with maple top, mahogany back, dual humbuckers, and the patented PRS tremolo. This semi-hollow version adds natural resonance and a vibrant, organic tone.

The humbuckers in this model are PRS 85/15 “S” pickups, which can be tapped via the push/pull tone control for more sounds. The addition of the LR Baggs/PRS Piezo system furthers the instrument’s versatility by offering electric and acoustic tones in one guitar. The PRS SE Custom 24 Semi-Hollow Piezo is designed with two discrete volume controls (magnetics and piezo) and output jacks (mix/piezo and magnetics). Players can plug into the “Mix/Piezo” jack and use the individual volume controls to blend the 85/15 “S” pickups with the piezo’s acoustic tones. Alternatively, players can plug into the jacks separately, so the guitar can run magnetic pickups into an amp and run the piezo through an acoustic amp or DI into the soundboard. When using the magnetic output jack in isolation, the piezo battery is bypassed completely, acting as a failsafe (in this scenario, the magnetic pickups still work even if the piezo battery has run out of juice).

Additional details include a matching headstock veneer, headstock and fretboard binding, and lampshade knobs. With nearly infinite tones and roadworthy reliability, the PRS SE Custom 24 Semi-Hollow Piezo is a modern classic that looks and feels as good as it sounds.

# SE McCarty 594 Laurel Burl Limited Edition

# Vintage Vibe Meets Modern Precision

The PRS SE McCarty 594 is designed to capture the essence of vintage guitar tones while delivering modern reliability. Named after Ted McCarty, the legendary guitar pioneer who influenced Paul Reed Smith’s early designs, this model strikes a balance between classic character and contemporary playability. This limited edition features a striking laurel burl veneer, adding a unique look to this popular model.

At its core, the SE McCarty 594 features a mahogany body with a maple top, combining warmth and sustain with a touch of brightness. The Pattern Vintage mahogany neck provides a familiar yet refined feel, while the rosewood fingerboard, adorned with PRS bird inlays, offers smooth playability across all 22 frets. The 24.594” scale length—just slightly shorter than typical PRS models—contributes to its vintage feel, adding to the guitar’s natural warmth and character.

Equipped with PRS 58/15 LT “S” pickups, the SE McCarty 594 Laurel Burl Limited Edition delivers clarity and fullness in equal measure. These pickups are designed to evoke the tones of the iconic instruments from the ‘50s, with the ability to handle both clean and overdriven settings with ease. The push/pull tone controls further enhance the guitar’s versatility, allowing players to access both humbucking and single-coil tones in one instrument. With a two-piece bridge and vintage-style tuners, the SE McCarty 594 Laurel Burl Limited Edition offers solid intonation and tuning stability.

Only 500 of these instruments will be made for 2025.

# SE CE 24

# Addictive Bolt-on Feel

The SE CE 24 pairs the traditional PRS Custom 24 combination of a maple top, mahogany back, and rosewood fretboard with a bolt-on maple neck. The added snap and response of bolt-on construction has been an essential part of guitar history from the beginning, and the CE’s voice and appointments carry that tradition forward with PRS’s unique spin on a classic. The 85/15 “S” pickups provide extended high and low end with clarity and balance, while the push/pull tone control adds the versatility of coil taps. The PRS SE CE 24 delivers tone, playability, and classic PRS looks that players of all styles can rock.

The PRS CE was originally introduced in 1988 and joined the SE Series for the first time in 2024.

# SE CE 24 Standard

# Professional Quality with a Popular Price Tag

Originally introduced in 1988, the CE has become an essential part of the PRS line-up, offering the snap and response of bolt-on construction. The SE CE 24 Standard is the most affordable CE yet, pairing an all-mahogany body with a bolt-on maple neck. The mahogany body features a thin satin finish that results in a highly resonant instrument, and the maple neck’s semi-gloss finish provides a smooth playing feel. The PRS 85/15 “S” pickups provide extended high and low end with clarity and balance, while the push/pull tone control adds the versatility of coil taps.

This workhorse instrument delivers looks, tone, and playability, and is a great option for beginning players through professional musicians thanks to its high-quality build and popular price tag.

# SE DGT Standard

# Understated Class

The PRS SE DGT Standard brings David Grissom’s signature model to a stripped-down, all-mahogany platform, delivering organic tone, rich resonance, and bold midrange presence.

Like the SE DGT, the SE DGT Standard offers a versatile control layout with individual volume controls for each pickup, a master tone control with push/pull coil tapping, and a satisfyingly smooth and responsive PRS tremolo. Moon inlays and two timeless finishes—McCarty Tobacco Sunburst, and Vintage Cherry—give this guitar an understated elegance that’s ready for the stage or studio.

Whether you’re chasing vintage character, flexible tone, or modern reliability, the SE DGT Standard offers it all in a guitar designed to be played.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo

Patented design, delivering tonal fidelity, player comfort, and tuning stability.

### PRS-Designed Tuners

# SE Hollowbody Standard Piezo

# Warmth and Resonance

The SE Hollowbody Standard Piezo features an all-mahogany body with hollow construction for a warm, resonant tone. Boasting 58/15 LT “S” pickups and an LR Baggs/PRS Piezo system, the SE Hollowbody Standard Piezo provides musicians with the versatility of wielding both acoustic and electric tones in one instrument. Additional appointments include a 22-fret wide fat neck, bone nut, and PRS adjustable Piezo stoptail bridge.

The instrument is designed with two discrete volume controls (magnetics and piezo) and output jacks (magnetics and mix/piezo). Players can plug into the “Mix/Piezo” jack and use the individual volume controls to blend the 58/15 “S” pickups with the piezo’s acoustic tones. Alternatively, players can plug into the jacks separately, so the guitar can run magnetic pickups into an amp and run the piezo through an acoustic amp or DI into the soundboard. When using the magnetic output jack in isolation, the piezo battery is bypassed completely, acting as a failsafe (in this scenario, the magnetic pickups still work even if the piezo battery has run out of juice).

The SE Hollowbody Standard Piezo is one guitar that can cover any gig in style.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Adjustable 'Piezo' Stoptail

Including six individual piezo-equipped saddles, this bridge works with the LR Baggs/PRS proprietary piezo electronics, to effortlessly achieve electric and acoustic sounds in one instrument.

### PRS-Designed Tuners

Designed to PRS's specifications, these lightweight tuners provide precise tuning and won't dampen your tone.

### PRS 58/15 LT “S”

“Low turn” pickups with vintage warmth and welcome clarity, designed to PRS’s specifications.

# SE Studio Standard

# Enrich Your Playing

The PRS SE Studio Standard brings the tone, playability, and versatility of the Studio model to the SE Series and into an understated, all-mahogany design with a classic pickguard aesthetic.

The all-mahogany body delivers a rich, focused tonal foundation with organic midrange warmth. The addition of a vintage-style pickguard gives the SE Studio Standard a bold and timeless aesthetic. With its 22 fret, 25” scale length bolt-on maple neck, the PRS SE Studio Standard is instantly comfortable to players of all backgrounds.

At the heart of the SE Studio Standard is its versatile trio of pickups: 58/15 LT “S” humbucker in the treble position with two Narrowfield DD “S” pickups in the middle and bass positions. The SE Studio Standard excels at delivering everything from warm mids to sparkling highs and rich lows. The 5-way blade switch and push/pull tone control allow for an array of pickup configurations, giving you the tools to cover any musical style.

The PRS SE Studio Standard is a no-frills, all-purpose guitar for players who demand versatility, reliability, and timeless style in one finely crafted instrument. Whether you’re recording in the studio or performing on stage, this guitar will inspire you with its dynamic voice and nearly limitless possibilities.

# SE Hollowbody II Piezo

# Acoustic and Electric Tones In One

The SE Hollowbody II Piezo combines the balanced, clear, resonant tone of a hollowbody instrument with the power and stability of a solid-body electric guitar. Constructed with a maple back and top with mahogany sides, the SE Hollowbody II Piezo offers a light shimmer and snap in an attractive package. The 58/15 LT “S” pickups deliver clarity and balance that sound big and musical in a hollowbody platform.

Boasting an LR Baggs/PRS Piezo system, the SE Hollowbody II Piezo provides musicians with the versatility of wielding both acoustic and electric tones in one instrument. The instrument is designed with two discrete volume controls (magnetics and piezo) and output jacks (mix/piezo and magnetics). Players can plug into the “Mix/Piezo” jack and use the individual volume controls to blend the 58/15 LT “S” pickups with the piezo’s acoustic tones. Alternatively, players can plug into the jacks separately, so the guitar can run magnetic pickups into an amp and run the piezo through an acoustic amp or DI into the soundboard. When using the magnetic output jack in isolation, the piezo battery is bypassed completely, acting as a failsafe (in this scenario, the magnetic pickups still work even if the piezo battery has run out of juice).

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Adjustable 'Piezo' Stoptail

Including six individual piezo-equipped saddles, this bridge works with the LR Baggs/PRS proprietary piezo electronics, to effortlessly achieve electric and acoustic sounds in one instrument.

### PRS-Designed Tuners

Designed to PRS's specifications, these lightweight tuners provide precise tuning and won't dampen your tone.

### PRS 58/15 LT “S”

“Low turn” pickups with vintage warmth and welcome clarity, designed to PRS’s specifications.

# SE NF3

# Versatile Workhorse

The PRS SE NF3 is a distinct guitar in the PRS lineup. The heart of this guitar is a trio of PRS Narrowfield pickups, a first for the SE Series. Supporting these pickups is a poplar body, 22-fret bolt-on maple neck, and a rosewood fretboard. The SE NF3 is a versatile workhorse guitar that is fun to play and hard to put down. The Narrowfield DD (Deep Dish) “S” pickups are made with taller bobbins to fit more winds and extra metal pieces in between the magnets for a more focused, powerful tone. Anchored with PRS’s patented tremolo, this guitar can bend and flutter with ease.

Perfect for rock, blues, gospel, country, or jazz the PRS SE NF3 can punch, cry, lay down, or sing – as you like it.

This model is also available with a maple fretboard. To explore that offering, please click here.

## Accolades

"I have always loved the PRS NF3. There was a long period where I couldn’t put it down! PRS has now introduced the SE NF3 and I was fortunate enough to get my hands on one… it’s a wonderful guitar! The pickups are really great and have a unique voice… its hard to believe PRS can make such a great guitar at this price point. I would highly recommend this guitar to anyone who wants a beefed up strat style guitar with a slightly slinkier feel."

- Jimmy Herring, Widespread Panic

# SE NF3 Maple

# Versatile Workhorse

The PRS SE NF3 is a distinct guitar in the PRS lineup. The heart of this guitar is a trio of PRS Narrowfield pickups, a first for the SE Series. Supporting these pickups is a poplar body, 22-fret bolt-on maple neck, and a maple fretboard. The SE NF3 is a versatile workhorse guitar that is fun to play and hard to put down. The Narrowfield DD (Deep Dish) “S” pickups are made with taller bobbins to fit more winds and extra metal pieces in between the magnets for a more focused, powerful tone. Anchored with PRS’s patented tremolo, this guitar can bend and flutter with ease.

Perfect for rock, blues, gospel, country, or jazz the PRS SE NF3 can punch, cry, lay down, or sing – as you like it.

This model is also available with a rosewood fretboard. To explore that offering, please click here.

## Accolades

"I have always loved the PRS NF3. There was a long period where I couldn’t put it down! PRS has now introduced the SE NF3 and I was fortunate enough to get my hands on one… it’s a wonderful guitar! The pickups are really great and have a unique voice… its hard to believe PRS can make such a great guitar at this price point. I would highly recommend this guitar to anyone who wants a beefed up strat style guitar with a slightly slinkier feel."

- Jimmy Herring, Widespread Panic

# SE NF 53

# Vintage Spirit. Timeless Tone.

The PRS SE NF 53 is a powerful, modern guitar inspired by classic tones and design. Built on the foundation of a swamp ash body and 22-fret, 25.5” scale length bolt-on maple neck and fretboard, the PRS SE NF 53 embodies the spirit of the electric guitar in the most timeless way. The addition of PRS Narrowfield DD “S” pickups brings a lot of power and musicality without the hum, making this guitar uniquely PRS.

PRS Narrowfield DD (Deep Dish) “S” pickups are made with taller bobbins to fit more winds and extra metal pieces in between the magnets for a focused, powerful tone. The “S” variation of these pickups brings articulate low-end tones and the snarl and twang you’d expect from this instrument – all as a noiseless humbucker, making it extremely receptive to gain. Paired with a volume and tone control and 3-way blade pickup switch, the NF 53 allows players to easily dial in their sound. Finally, the steel plate-style bridge with brass barrel saddles adds to the PRS SE NF 53’s lively tone and resonance.

# SE Swamp Ash Special

# Fresh Face and Versatile Voice

The PRS SE Swamp Ash Special is a unique offering in the growing PRS SE Series. With a swamp ash body and 22-fret maple neck with maple fretboard, the SE Swamp Ash Special is a fresh face and versatile voice.

The 85/15 “S” pickups flank a PRS-Designed AS-01 Single Coil “S” pickup in the middle position. The AS-01 Single Coil features both alnico and steel (hence the name), which adds mass to the pickups helping to create a powerful sound. Paired with a push/pull tone control and 5-way pickup switch, this pickup/electronics package gives players an array of sounds to enjoy, and the addition of PRS’s patented tremolo adds a touch more versatility. The overall tone of the PRS SE Swamp Ash Special offers tight low-end, bright but mellow high-end, and a welcome twangy tone that can reach “hot country,” blues, and even jazz territory.

# SE Studio

# Explore the Possibilities

The PRS SE Studio features a trio of powerful pickups in a sleek design, bridging the gap between classic tones and modern versatility.

Built with a mahogany back and maple top, the PRS SE Studio delivers rich, resonant tones, thanks also to its “single”/”single”/hum pickup configuration. This combination of PRS Narrowfield DD “S” bass and middle pickups with a PRS 58/15 LT “S” treble humbucker provides a wide range of tonal options, including lush humbucking warmth, single-coil clarity, and everything in between. The 5-way blade switch and push/pull tone control further enhance its versatility, making this guitar a tonal chameleon for any genre or playing style.

The 22-fret, 25” scale-length maple neck features a Wide Thin carve for a comfortable, authoritative playing experience, and the rosewood fretboard is adorned with PRS’s iconic bird inlays for a touch of class. With PRS-designed tuners and our patented tremolo bridge, the SE Studio offers rock-solid tuning stability and expressive performance, all at an accessible price point.

Whether you’re practicing at home, recording in the studio, or performing on stage, the PRS SE Studio provides an addictive playing experience.

## Accolades

“The PRS SE line packs a punch way above its weight class and they've always found a way to remain consistent with offering more value for what you get. I opened the guitar out of the box, plugged in and went straight to work. Its a blessing when you don't have to worry about the tools you use.”

- - Rony Feliz / Pitbull

“As soon as I took it out of the box, the SE Studio felt and sounded familiar to me, like fitting into a worn-in baseball glove. My introduction to PRS guitars began with the SE line, and to this day, the guitar with the most miles on tour (over 165 shows annually) is still one of my SE’s. You know they did something right when you never have to worry about your instrument; it just works and sounds amazing. PRS created that for me. The SE Studio is a home run!”

- - Rony Feliz / Pitbull

# SE Special Semi-Hollow

# Shape Your Tone. Define Your Style.

The PRS SE Special Semi-Hollow is a versatile workhorse, perfect for players looking to explore new sonic horizons with uncompromised playability and quality. With the lush tones of a semi-hollow body and the versatility of a hum/“single”/hum setup, this guitar delivers a world of musical possibilities, bringing PRS’s innovative Narrowfield DD pickup design and intuitive coil-tap switching system to the SE Series in a classic maple top guitar. The semi-hollow construction also enhances sustain and resonance, while the f-hole adds a classic aesthetic. A 22-fret, 25” scale-length maple neck with a rosewood fretboard and PRS bird inlays ensures smooth playability and an iconic look.

The PRS SE Special Semi-Hollow is equipped with a pair of 58/15 LT “S” pickups with a PRS Narrowfield DD “S” in the middle position and a versatile coil-tap setup that unlocks a wide range of tones—from warm, full humbucker sounds to crisp single-coil chime. This three-pickup configuration allows for unique tonal options, making this model a go-to for genres ranging from jazz and blues to rock and beyond. Finished with PRS-designed tuners and the patented PRS tremolo bridge, the PRS SE Special Semi-Hollow delivers roadworthy reliability with studio-worthy tone.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo

## Accolades

“Awesome guitar! The Special Semi-Hollow SE brings all the versatility and playability of the Core series into a more affordable package! I was also thoroughly impressed by the pickups. I’ve always had a pet peeve with muddy neck humbuckers and icy pick bright bridge humbuckers, and with PRS’s for the first time in my life I’m not having to EQ myself out of a problem. They sound really balanced with a tight low end, a round top and a full with a nice mid range. Highly recommend grabbing one!”

# SE 277

# Texture and Versatility

Built with a longer 27.7” scale length, the SE 277 is perfect for heavier, more aggressive guitar playing. But this is no one-trick pony. The 277’s 85/15 “S” pickups were designed to deliver remarkable clarity and extended high and low end, allowing the 277 to handle blues and funk with flair as well. Additional appointments include a string-through bridge design for strong, resonant tone.

Whether you’re interested in rocking a clean tone, picking bass lines beneath higher melodies on one guitar, or chugging out the heaviest drop-tuned riffs, the SE 277 offers versatility in a reliable package for players looking to push the envelope. Ships tuned B to B.

## Accolades

"Try as I might, I couldn’t find a dang thing wrong or even slightly unsatisfying with the PRS SE 277. It’s comfortable, fun, and easy to play; has a wide range of versatile, simple-to-control tones; and proved a gleeful partner in sonic mayhem as well as a suave traditionalist.”

- Premier Guitar

"Not just for metalheads, this affordable baritone from PRS is far from a one-trick pony.”

- Guitar-Bass.net

“I love how this guitar is great at heavy and aggressive music but can play pretty much any style of music you want to play on it. This may be the most versatile of all the guitars in this review.”

# SE Mark Holcomb SVN

# Aggressive Clarity

The SE Mark Holcomb SVN model truly stands on its own in the PRS lineup and delivers addictive playability thanks to some unique specifications, including a 24-fret, 26.5” scale length, wide thin satin maple neck with 20” radius ebony fretboard. Holcomb’s signature Seymour Duncan Scarlet and Scourge 7-string pickups provide the right amount of output and articulation whether you’re playing sophisticated chords or solos and whether you’re playing alone or working in the mix of a band. Other specifications include black hardware, a 3-way blade pickup switch with push/pull tone knob for coil tapping, and a quilted maple veneer. The model is topped off with a string-through, plate-style, 7-string bridge.

“My SE SVN has become the perfect counterpart to my SE six-string, and an absolute mainstay in Periphery’s live rig. It’s designed to be aggressive, but its core features allow it to be diverse enough to handle clean and mid-gain tones just as effectively. If you’ve played my SE six, you’ll find that this builds off what we established with that guitar and more.” - Mark Holcomb, Periphery

# SE Zach Myers "Lefty"

# Unbelievable Feel and Price

The SE Zach Myers is packed with features that will satisfy even the most demanding musicians. Featuring a chambered mahogany body with maple cap, flame maple veneer, and single f-hole, the SE Zach Myers provides smooth mid-range tones with a natural, resonant internal reverb. The resonance of the semi-hollow body paired with the smooth feel of the satin finish neck will make an immediate impression in your hands. Additional appointments to the SE Zach Myers signature model include a 22-fret, 24.594” scale length neck, PRS adjustable stoptail bridge, vintage-style tuners, and PRS-designed 245 “S” pickups paired with two volume and two tone controls and a 3-way toggle pickup switch. These pickups bring high-end clarity, low-end power, and an overall aggressive punch that maintains a certain sweetness.

Zach Myers, lead guitarist of the multi-platinum rock band Shinedown, picked up a PRS Custom 22 at the age of fifteen and announced his first SE signature model in 2010. As a guitarist who has rocked PRS on stage and teched for several PRS bands, Myers has an intimate understanding of how a guitar should feel and what the build quality should be. Those details have again created an eye-popping player’s guitar that can take a beating.

# SE Silver Sky Rosewood "Lefty"

# Reach for the Sky

The SE Silver Sky is a familiar iteration of the original Silver Sky model that was first introduced with John Mayer in 2018. This workhorse guitar provides ample tone and playability in four distinct colors, delivering looks, feel, and sound.

The PRS SE Silver Sky starts with a poplar body, bolt-on maple neck, and rosewood fretboard with PRS trademark bird inlays. The 22-fret, 25.5” scale length neck features the original 635JM carve and an 8.5” fretboard radius, so the PRS SE Silver Sky will feel right at home. Plug it in, and the three single-coil 635JM “S” pick-ups will bark and sing. This guitar is anchored by a two-point steel tremolo, synthetic bone nut, and vintage-style tuners. Other design features include the PRS Silver Sky inverted headstock shape and the PRS double-acting truss rod (accessible from the front of the headstock for ease of use). Ships with PRS Classic 10-46 strings and gig bag.

This model is also available with a maple fretboard. To explore that offering, please click here.

# SE DGT

# Meticulously Vintage

“I didn’t just rubber stamp this. This guitar is something I have been very involved in and am really proud of. The SE Series is lightyears ahead of anything I could get my hands on when I started playing - it’s amazing how far the quality has come – and I am proud to be able to offer this guitar to more people.” - David Grissom

The PRS SE DGT (David Grissom Trem) brings David Grissom’s signature model to the SE Series for the first time. Based on the McCarty platform, the DGT model has been a constant favorite since its introduction in 2007, thanks to Grissom’s deep knowledge of vintage guitars and his painstaking attention to detail. Every feature on the SE DGT has been considered from the neck shape to the fret choice and dressing, from the colors to the pickups and electronics layout.

The SE DGT features vintage-voiced humbuckers paired with individual volume controls for each pickup and a push/pull master tone control that taps the humbuckers for sweet, single-coil inspired sounds. This layout puts a lot of control and versatility on tap so you can focus on playing and not the guitar. Additional appointments include a maple top, mahogany back, 22-fret, 25” scale length mahogany neck with rosewood fretboard, and bird or moon inlays (inlays are color dependent).

# SE Santana

# Legendary Tone

Carlos Santana’s influence as a PRS artist led to the development of our SE electric guitar series, which launched in 2001. In honor of that legacy, PRS is proud to offer the SE Santana model. The SE Santana features a 24.594” scale length on a 24 fret neck, the PRS patented molded tremolo, Santana “S” humbuckers, and the same Santana body shape silhouette as Santana’s revered American-made PRS models. We believe this guitar and its appointments honor Santana’s skill and style better than ever and offer players great quality and value. Be sure to try an SE Santana at an authorized dealer near you.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo

Patented design, delivering tonal fidelity, player comfort, and tuning stability.

### PRS-Designed Tuners

Designed to PRS's specifications, these lightweight tuners provide precise tuning and won't dampen your tone.

### PRS Santana “S”

Warm, smooth tone that can bite when you dig in.

# SE Mark Holcomb

# Mercilessly Addictive

The band Periphery has become a force to be reckoned with in the progressive metal scene thanks to their complex rhythms and soaring melodies. Guitarist Mark Holcomb helps achieve this full, lethal sound with his PRS guitars and signature Seymour Duncan Scarlet and Scourge pickups. PRS and Holcomb have worked closely together to develop a truly unique guitar for the SE Series lineup.

"With my SE signature model, we managed to capture all of the defining characteristics of my Maryland-made guitar and turn it into a streamlined, less-costly package. It is an incredibly special instrument, and one that is now the primary focus of my rig in the studio and onstage." - Mark Holcomb, Periphery

The SE Mark Holcomb model truly stands on its own in the PRS lineup and delivers addictive playability thanks to some unique specifications, including a 24-fret, 25.5” scale length wide thin satin maple neck with 20” radius ebony fretboard. Holcomb’s signature pickups provide the right amount of output and articulation whether you’re playing sophisticated chords or solos and whether you’re playing alone or working in the mix of a band. Other specifications include a quilted maple veneer, black chrome hardware, and a 3-way blade pickup switch with push/pull tone knob for coil tapping.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Plate Style (String Through)

Designed with individual saddles for perfect intonation and string-through design for increased resonance and sustain.

### PRS-Designed Tuners

Designed to PRS's specifications, these lightweight tuners provide precise tuning and won't dampen your tone.

### Mark Holcomb Signature Seymour Duncan “Scarlet” & “Scourge”

The right amount of output to deliver aggression with clarity and articulation.

## Accolades

"This PRS SE is super playable, sleek, and has monstrous tone...we think this is one of the most exciting guitars so far this year! At the price, we also think it’s a fabulous value for the money.”

- Guitar Interactive

"The spec on offer here represents a high quality and, dare we say it, ‘posh’ metal guitar with a little bit extra under the hood thanks to the split-coil tones.”

# SE Paul's Guitar

# Paul’s Favorite Features In Your Hands

“The SE Paul’s Guitar is a great example of design, engineering, and teamwork. It’s as close to home as we could get inside of the SE Series, and I am very proud of it,” - Paul Reed Smith

The SE Paul’s Guitar delivers a lot of “PRS,” starting with tone and versatility. The TCI “S” treble and bass pickups deliver a pure, vintage sound. The SE Paul’s Guitar also features two mini-toggle switches between the volume and tone knobs, which enable you to coil tap both pickups independently, yielding eight total pickup combinations. The PRS stoptail bridge is the same machined stoptail with brass inserts as spec'd on the Core Paul's Guitar.

“The Paul’s Guitar, like the Modern Eagle before it, has always been about Paul’s latest discoveries in guitar making. To bring this guitar into the SE Series, we knew the tone, functionality, and playability had to be right and had to be consistent,” said Jack Higginbotham, COO, PRS Guitars. “We feel this guitar offers a lot of value to players.”

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Stoptail with Brass Inserts

Engineered with curved string slots with brass inserts and brass studs to take full advantage of the resonant properties of the guitar.

### Vintage-Style Tuners

Traditional closed-back tuners engineered to promote resonance.

### PRS TCI “S”

Musical pickups that offer versatile tones from spanky single coils to full soapbars. Designed to PRS’s specification.

## Accolades

“The import version of Paul’s Guitar delivers a big dollop of the sort of looks you get from a high-end PRS, and the sound and playability make it feel much more expensive than it is.”

- Premier Guitar

“Aside from the effortless playability, intonation, tuning stability and old-world resonance (all foundations of the PRS empire), the single-coil voices from these new TCI pickups raise the bar, while the humbucking side seems to pack musical heat, clarity and considerable versatility in equal measure.”

# SE Zach Myers

# Unbelievable Feel and Price

The SE Zach Myers is packed with features that will satisfy even the most demanding musicians. Featuring a chambered mahogany body with maple cap, flame maple veneer, and single f-hole, the SE Zach Myers provides smooth mid-range tones with a natural, resonant internal reverb. The resonance of the semi-hollow body paired with the smooth feel of the satin finish neck will make an immediate impression in your hands. Additional appointments to the SE Zach Myers signature model include a 22-fret, 24.594” scale length neck, PRS adjustable stoptail bridge, vintage-style tuners, and PRS-designed 245 “S” pickups paired with two volume and two tone controls and a 3-way toggle pickup switch. These pickups bring high-end clarity, low-end power, and an overall aggressive punch that maintains a certain sweetness.

Zach Myers, lead guitarist of the multi-platinum rock band Shinedown, picked up a PRS Custom 22 at the age of fifteen and announced his first SE signature model in 2010. As a guitarist who has rocked PRS on stage and teched for several PRS bands, Myers has an intimate understanding of how a guitar should feel and what the build quality should be. Those details have again created an eye-popping player’s guitar that can take a beating.

“When I was younger, I always wanted a “Private Stock” guitar, but I couldn’t afford one. When I told Paul the SE Zach Myers reminded me of that, he laughed, but also slightly agreed. The goal of the PRS SE Zach Myers has always been to make a guitar that stood out in the long line of amazing, affordable guitars that is the SE Series. The appointments we selected for this guitar, I feel, make it one of the best guitars you buy on the market right now – no matter the price point…even though this guitar is priced for everyone to afford. I hope players of all styles and levels enjoy it.” – Zach Myers

### PRS 245 “S” Pickups

## Accolades

"The PRS SE Zach Myers is a well-realized and well-built instrument that, quite honestly, can stand toe-to-toe with semi-hollows that cost four times its price. But beyond its obvious hard-rock pedigree, it’s a very versatile instrument that can handle most any genre of music. In fact, the SE Zach Myers is a top-notch axe capable of so much that it almost seems criminally underpriced."

# SE Silver Sky Rosewood

# Reach For The Sky

The SE Silver Sky is a familiar iteration of the original Silver Sky model that was first introduced with John Mayer in 2018. This workhorse guitar provides ample tone and playability in four distinct colors, delivering looks, feel, and sound.

The PRS SE Silver Sky starts with a poplar body, bolt-on maple neck, and rosewood fretboard with PRS trademark bird inlays. The 22-fret, 25.5” scale length neck features the original 635JM carve and an 8.5” fretboard radius, so the PRS SE Silver Sky will feel right at home. Plug it in, and the three single-coil 635JM “S” pickups will bark and sing. This guitar is anchored by a two-point steel tremolo, synthetic bone nut, and vintage-style tuners. Other design features include the PRS Silver Sky inverted headstock shape and the PRS double-acting truss rod (accessible from the front of the headstock for ease of use). Ships with PRS Classic 10-46 strings and gig bag.

This model is also available with a maple fretboard. To explore that offering, please click here.

# Explore Our Acoustic Line

## OUR BUILD PHILOSOPHY

PRS acoustics are built on the theory that an acoustic guitar should act like a speaker cabinet: the back and sides strongly braced to lock them down and a thin top braced with a hybrid X/Classical bracing pattern to encourage the top to vibrate more freely. This theory was developed after studying an extraordinary-sounding Torres nylon-string acoustic that was similarly braced. Many acoustic guitars are thought of as double-diaphragm instruments, allowing the back to be one of the vibrating surfaces. This allows for some of the guitar's energy, tone, and volume to be lost through the back of the instrument and dulled by the player's body. If you want a strong, loud acoustic, all the energy and sound should project through the top. This build philosophy allows PRS acoustics to project boldly and gives them their signature sound.

## Bracing

## PRS LADDER-STYLE BACK & SIDE BRACING

PRS acoustics are strongly braced on the back and sides. We think of this part of the guitar like a speaker cabinet - it is locked down to help push the sound through the front of the guitar.

## PRS HYBRID X / CLASSICAL TOP BRACING

PRS Hybrid X/Classical bracing is designed to promote the top's vibration, which helps the instrument project much like the cone of a speaker. The X-brace is designed to keep steel-string acoustic tops from lifting (by crossing behind the bridge, the X-brace counterbalances the pull of the strings). This style of fan bracing is typically found on classical, nylon-string acoustics. By fanning across the belly of the guitar, this bracing helps the top to vibrate.

## BODY SHAPES

## Angelus Cutaway

PRS Angelus Cutaway models are named after the Latin word for “angel” and have responsive highs, crisply-defined lows, and sweet midrange. The cutaway body shape provides increased access to the higher frets. Though well suited for fingerstyle players, these models are versatile enough for myriad musical styles.

## Tonare Grand

Tonare models are named after the Latin word for “thunder” and offer substantial volume and midrange and beefy low end with balanced highs. Wonderful for strumming, these guitars also lend themselves to flatpickers as well as nuanced players.

## Tonare Parlor

Tonare Parlor acoustics, also named for the word “thunder,” are a smaller overall size, but maintain the bold projection of PRS acoustics with a more focused tone. These guitars also feature a shorter scale length and are very comfortable to play for hours on end.

## Tonewoods

While many other factors affect the ultimate tone of the guitar, the woods used to build an acoustic guitar are the foundation of the instrument and its tone. Different woods have different densities and different stiffnesses, for example, which translate to different resonant frequencies and degrees of sustain. Here are a few examples of woods used on PRS acoustic back and sides and some general attributes for each.

## Mahogany

- Midrange forward tone
- Warm and “woody”
- Mahogany-spec'd acoustics are great for solo players, considering their direct tonal character
## Ovankol

- Wide tonal spectrum
- Lush and full
- Ovangkol is similar to rosewood in tone and complements many playing styles
## Ziricote

- Full bottom end and rolled-off highs
- Rich and broad
- Ziricote-spec'd acoustics offer hi-fi tone reminiscent of some vintage acoustics
## Maple

- Depth and transparency of tone
- Bright and clean
- PRS maple-spec'd acoustics have more warmth than many other maple acoustics on the market
## ADDITIONAL FEATURES

## Bone Nut/Saddle

All PRS acoustics feature bone nuts and saddles. One of the tenents of guitar making at PRS is: “anything that touches the string is God.” The nut and saddle on an acoustic are the two main points where the energy (vibration) of the string is transferred through the guitar. Bone is a hard material (that can still be shaped to fit) and helps the guitar to sustain longer with more tonal character.

## PRS Double-Action Truss Rod

The PRS double-action truss rod provides neck adjustments in both directions, allowing our necks to be fully adjustable. The double acting rod achieves twice the amount of adjustment as a single acting rod with the same amount of movement of the adjusting nut.

## PRS-Voiced Fishman Presys VT Pickup*

EQ'd in Paul Reed Smith's home studio and implemented by Larry Fishman and his engineering team, the PRS-Voiced Fishman Presys VT Pickup provides players with a warm, organic tone that allows the natural sound of the instrument to come through.

## Ebony Fretboard and Bridge*

*All PRS SE Series acoustics come with an ebony fretboard and bridge and PRS-Voiced Fishman Presys VT pickup. Private Stock acoustics may use other materials.

# Private Stock 40th Anniversary McCarty Dragon

# Celebrating Four Decades of Craftsmanship & Innovation

The PRS Private Stock 40th Anniversary McCarty Dragon embodies the spirit of PRS, showcasing stunning visual design and uncompromised playability and tone.

“When I was a teenager, I had a dream about a guitar with a dragon inlaid down the neck. That dream became reality for the first time in 1992 and has since become an important part of our history. For our 40th Anniversary, we have chosen a McCarty model as the foundation of the Dragon, which is only fitting considering the original 1992 Dragon was the beginning of what would become the McCarty model. I’m proud to bring these two, now-historic, PRS designs together.” – Paul Reed Smith, Founder & Managing General Partner, PRS Guitars

The PRS McCarty model was first introduced in 1994 and was essentially PRS’s first 22-fret, vintage-leaning instrument. Featuring a slightly thicker mahogany back, stoptail bridge with brass inserts and steel studs, and PRS’s new McCarty III pickups, the Private Stock 40th Anniversary McCarty Dragon is not just a work of art, it is a professional-grade, musical instrument. Every inch of the stoptail bridge is designed to maximize the transfer of the strings’ vibration through the instrument and the McCarty III pickups amplify that tone with a lush, vocal quality that is warm, clear, and open.

The visual draw of this guitar is the extraordinary dragon inlay drawn by Jeff Easley, a fantasy artist famous for many Dungeons & Dragons rulebook covers, and designed and recreated as inlay by the team at Aulson Inlay. The Dragon is comprised of more than 200 pieces of inlay in an array of materials, including Blue Pacific Opal, Brown Scale Juma, and Gold, Black, White, and Brown Mother of Pearl. The inlay extends onto the truss rod cover and visually leaps off the pale moon ebony fretboard. The Private Stock Eagle inlaid on the headstock is made from Black with Gold Web and outlined in Gold Mother of Pearl.

“I feel fortunate to have worked on PRS Dragons since 2002. Being part of this endeavor has made me feel connected to something greater that will endure beyond my time. Moreover, I have thoroughly enjoyed collaborating with Paul through the years. His ability to challenge me to step outside my comfort zone has facilitated the development of innovative techniques that make the previously impossible achievable. Through Paul’s unwavering support, our team at Aulson Inlay has evolved into an exceptional collaborative. I often wish Larry Sifel could witness the significant progress Paul and the dragons have made since the inception of the Dragon in 1992.” – Jaime Aulson Myers, Co-Founder & Co-Owner of Aulson Inlay

Only 165 Private Stock 40th Anniversary McCarty Dragon models will be made.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Stoptail w/ Brass Inserts & Steel Studs

Engineered with curved string slots with brass inserts and steel studs, this bridge is designed to maximize the transfer of the strings’ vibrations through the instrument.

### PRS Phase III Non-Locking Tuners

With vintage elegance, these lightweight tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS McCarty III Pickups

# SE Chleo

# Awaken The Dragon

“With the PRS SE Chleo, we set out to create the best affordable guitar that delivers a unique combination of effortless playability, outstanding craftsmanship, and versatile tonal range. It combines modern innovations with classic style, giving players the tools they need to create everything from classic tones to cutting edge new sounds. The SE Chleo proves that a world-class instrument doesn’t have to break the bank—it’s a guitar that brings high-end performance within reach for everyone.” – Herman Li, DragonForce

The PRS SE Chleo is the result of an intimate collaboration between PRS Guitars and award-winning guitar player Herman Li. Li, best known for his work as one of the lead guitar players in the power metal band DragonForce, is a demanding guitarist known for his fast and precise playing style. Based on the exclusive 2025 PRS Chleo Limited Edition, this SE signature model is a unique guitar in the PRS lineup designed with the modern metal guitarist in mind.

The PRS SE Chleo features a maple top and mahogany back with maple neck and ebony fretboard. The body features a sculpted carve that allows it to be very thin and very lightweight overall, so you can play longer and with more energy. The neck shape and neck joint were specially designed to be comfortable and fast. The neck is very thin front-to-back with a slightly taller playing surface and 20” fretboard radius, and the added high-modulus carbon fiber strength rods ensure a strong neck that promotes sustain. The fretboard features “Eclipse Dragon” inlays, and PRS’s trademark scoop has also been modified for ultimate access to the upper frets. All this plus a Floyd Rose locking tremolo mean you can dig in and play hard without sacrifice.

The PRS SE Chleo boasts the same signature pickups as the Limited Edition that preceded it. The Fishman Fluence Signature Series Omniforce Herman Li pickups feature copper-free layered PCB’s for consistency and no-hum tones. With three distinct voices and a versatile switching system, the guitar offers up to 13 unique tone combinations. From fat, aggressive rhythm tones to smooth, warm leads, soaring screams, and crystal-clear single-coil sounds, these pickups cover it all. The performance-friendly control layout makes it easy to switch between tones on the fly. Whether you’re using high-gain tube amps, modern amp modelers, or DAW plugins, the Chleo’s pickups are built to shine across any setup.

Push boundaries and forge your own ground with the PRS SE Chleo.

## Featured Specifications

### Floyd Rose 1000 Tremolo w/ PRS Locking Nut

Low-profile design. Made to stay in tune through the heaviest dive-bombing sessions.

### PRS-Designed Tuners

Designed to PRS's specifications, these lightweight tuners provide precise tuning and won't dampen your tone.

### Fishman Fluence Omniforce Pickups - Herman Li Signature

Featuring three distinct voices per pickup and a versatile switching system, the Omniforce set offers up to 13 tone combinations — from powerful high-output tones to articulate single-coil sounds. The middle single coil is designed to sit low against the body for improved picking comfort and tonal balance.

### Built to Play Fast

The PRS SE Chleo features a reinforced maple neck with a uniquely thin profile and 20-inch-radiused ebony fretboard, so you can play fast. Its deeper scoop allows ultimate access to all 24 frets.

# SE Chleo

# Awaken The Dragon

“With the PRS SE Chleo, we set out to create the best affordable guitar that delivers a unique combination of effortless playability, outstanding craftsmanship, and versatile tonal range. It combines modern innovations with classic style, giving players the tools they need to create everything from classic tones to cutting edge new sounds. The SE Chleo proves that a world-class instrument doesn’t have to break the bank—it’s a guitar that brings high-end performance within reach for everyone.” – Herman Li, DragonForce

The PRS SE Chleo is the result of an intimate collaboration between PRS Guitars and award-winning guitar player Herman Li. Li, best known for his work as one of the lead guitar players in the power metal band DragonForce, is a demanding guitarist known for his fast and precise playing style. Based on the exclusive 2025 PRS Chleo Limited Edition, this SE signature model is a unique guitar in the PRS lineup designed with the modern metal guitarist in mind.

The PRS SE Chleo features a maple top and mahogany back with maple neck and ebony fretboard. The body features a sculpted carve that allows it to be very thin and very lightweight overall, so you can play longer and with more energy. The neck shape and neck joint were specially designed to be comfortable and fast. The neck is very thin front-to-back with a slightly taller playing surface and 20” fretboard radius, and the added high-modulus carbon fiber strength rods ensure a strong neck that promotes sustain. The fretboard features “Eclipse Dragon” inlays, and PRS’s trademark scoop has also been modified for ultimate access to the upper frets. All this plus a Floyd Rose locking tremolo mean you can dig in and play hard without sacrifice.

The PRS SE Chleo boasts the same signature pickups as the Limited Edition that preceded it. The Fishman Fluence Signature Series Omniforce Herman Li pickups feature copper-free layered PCB’s for consistency and no-hum tones. With three distinct voices and a versatile switching system, the guitar offers up to 13 unique tone combinations. From fat, aggressive rhythm tones to smooth, warm leads, soaring screams, and crystal-clear single-coil sounds, these pickups cover it all. The performance-friendly control layout makes it easy to switch between tones on the fly. Whether you’re using high-gain tube amps, modern amp modelers, or DAW plugins, the Chleo’s pickups are built to shine across any setup.

Push boundaries and forge your own ground with the PRS SE Chleo.

## Featured Specifications

### Floyd Rose 1000 Tremolo w/ PRS Locking Nut

Low-profile design. Made to stay in tune through the heaviest dive-bombing sessions.

### PRS-Designed Tuners

Designed to PRS's specifications, these lightweight tuners provide precise tuning and won't dampen your tone.

### Fishman Fluence Omniforce Pickups - Herman Li Signature

Featuring three distinct voices per pickup and a versatile switching system, the Omniforce set offers up to 13 tone combinations — from powerful high-output tones to articulate single-coil sounds. The middle single coil is designed to sit low against the body for improved picking comfort and tonal balance.

### Built to Play Fast

The PRS SE Chleo features a reinforced maple neck with a uniquely thin profile and 20-inch-radiused ebony fretboard, so you can play fast. Its deeper scoop allows ultimate access to all 24 frets.

# Silver Sky

# Reach For The Sky

“It’s been a dream of mine for years to design a guitar that includes some of my favorite vintage specifications but with a modern spirit and aesthetic. After two years of study and refinement, the Silver Sky is my vision of what a reboot of the electric guitar should look and feel like.” – John Mayer

The PRS Silver Sky is an idealized version of a vintage single-coil guitar where every detail adds up and sets this guitar apart from the pack and the past. The result of a close collaboration between Grammy Award-winning musician John Mayer and Paul Reed Smith, the Silver Sky is based off of years of development. Incorporating Mayer and Smith’s favorite elements of 1963 and 1964 instruments with an eye toward modern references, the PRS Silver Sky delivers the warmth and familiarity of an old guitar with the finesse of a brand-new instrument.

Some of the more distinctive specifications include, the headstock shape, tuners, bridge, pickups, and neck and fretboard options. The headstock shape is based on PRS’s trademark design, but inverted both to accommodate Mayer’s playing style and also to keep a consistent length of string behind the nut, which makes staying in tune easier. The tuners are a traditional vintage-style, closed-back tuner, but with PRS’s locking design. The steel tremolo takes the patented PRS design and incorporates Gen III knife-edge screws. Setup flush to the body in the neutral position so that the tremolo bridge only goes down in pitch, the bridge’s increased contact with the body allows the guitar itself to be acoustically louder, which in turn improves the signal to noise ratio of the single-coil pickups. The 635JM single-coil pickups are very round and full, with a musical high end that is never “ice-picky” or brash.

The Silver Sky comes with the option of a rosewood or maple fretboard. The maple fretboard option comes with the original 635JM neck shape, while the rosewood fretboard option has been subtly modified in the shoulders to feel more “rounded” in your hand. Both neck shapes were designed by researching vintage instruments and Mayer test-driving guitars on stage to find what felt right. The fretboard radius on both options is 7.25”.

Other high-quality specifications include a bone nut, a molded metal jack plate (curved to make plugging and unplugging a guitar cable hassle-free), retooled knobs, and PRS’s double action truss rod (accessible from the front of the headstock for ease of use). PRS premium gig bag included.

This model is also available with a maple fretboard. To explore that offering, please click here.

## Accolades

- Premier Guitar

“[The PRS Silver Sky] offers up shockingly good vintage tones and feel, but modern production methods and PRS’s legendary attention to detail have eliminated all the problems that go along with vintage instruments…including the monstrous price tag!”

- Guitar Interactive

“Tonally, it’s big, clear, and airy when played clean, and fat and resonant with overdrive kicked on…There’s so much to dig with this guitar, but most are sure to keep going back to that heel and amazing upper-fret reach, which changes everything.”

- Vintage Guitar

“After playing the Silver Sky, it’s easy to understand why it took so long to design and why John Mayer embraced this endeavor. For aficionados of the classic three single-coil pickup solidbody guitar design, this is truly one of the finest examples ever produced.”

- Guitar World

“A superb vintage and experience-informed three single-coil bolt-on. Build playability, sound and typical PRS attention to detail and quality.”

- Music Radar

"Bottom line: The Silver Sky absolutely delivers on the promise of being a damn-near-perfect version of this type of guitar…Paul Reed Smith doesn’t mess around, and you’ve got to assume that he never would have made this guitar if he didn’t think he could bring something inspiring to the party.”

- Guitar Player

“This is not simply a Strat with a PRS headstock. As Paul Reed Smith pointed out in an interview, every aspect of the guitar was thoughtfully designed, or redesigned. But don’t just take our word for it. Try one out. You may be just as impressed as we are.”

- MusicPlayers.com

"This guitar isn't designed to be just a collector's item that is hung on a wall to look at, it was built to be played and pushed to the limit."

- Maverick Magazine

“You can take as many modern or vintage twists as you want on an instrument. The real question is: does it work on stage or in the studio? Silver Sky works.”

- Clay Cook, Zac Brown Band

“Man I am hooked on this Silver Sky. Can’t stop playing it! The feel and dynamics are really next level.”

- Eric Krasno

“The Silver Sky is the closest anyone has ever come to bettering Leo's original blueprint for the Stratocaster.”

# Mark Holcomb

# Play With Power

Mark Holcomb, renowned for his groundbreaking work with progressive metal band Periphery, brings his signature style and precision to the PRS lineup with a guitar built for versatility and power. Holcomb’s innovative riffing, a cornerstone of Periphery’s dense triple-guitar sound, comes to life on stages worldwide with his PRS signature models.

A standout in the PRS family, the Mark Holcomb model features a mango top, a 25.5” scale length maple neck, and an ebony fretboard with a 20” radius—crafted for speed and precision. Equipped with Holcomb’s signature Seymour Duncan Scarlet and Scourge pickups, this guitar delivers focused low-end punch and crystal-clear articulation, ensuring complex chord voicings, coil-splitting, and drop tunings remain defined and dynamic. The 5-way blade switch unlocks a range of tones, from dual humbuckers in position three to coil-split options in positions two and four.

With satin black hardware and seven eye-catching finishes, the Mark Holcomb model doesn’t just sound exceptional—it looks the part too. Whether you’re shredding metal, chicken-pickin’, or exploring jazzy improvisations, this guitar delivers uncompromising performance and boundless fun, ready to meet the demands of any genre.

# Custom 24

# The One That Started It All

The Custom 24 is the original PRS. Since its introduction, it has offered a unique option for serious players and defined PRS tone and playability.

Played by internationally touring artists, gigging musicians, and aspiring players, the Custom 24 features a figured maple top and mahogany back with a 24-fret, 25” scale length mahogany neck with rosewood fretboard. Anchored by PRS’s patented Gen III tremolo and Phase III tuners with wing buttons the Custom 24 is known for its playability, versatility, and tuning stability.

The Custom 24 is outfitted with PRS DMO treble and bass pickups with volume and tone controls and a 5-way blade switch. DMO (Dynamic, Musical, Open) pickups were personally designed by Paul Reed Smith and the PRS New Products Engineering team. From our own hands-on research into coveted vintage pickup models to advancements in signal analyzation and “tuning” technology, these pickups incorporate every detail of pickup knowledge PRS has gained in recent years of R&D.

PRS DMO pickups have a “wide open” sound with vocal character, meaning they deliver clear, pleasant-sounding tones across a wide range of frequencies (bass to treble) in each pickup.

The Custom 24 is the quintessential PRS guitar. This iconic instrument was the first model that Paul Reed Smith brought to the public at PRS Guitars’ first Winter NAMM show in 1985 and has been a top seller ever since.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo, Gen III

Meticulous design delivering sonic fidelity, player ergonomics, and revolutionary tuning stability.

### PRS Phase III Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

Modern locking technology with vintage elegance, these lightweight tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS DMO Pickups

“Dynamic, Musical, Open” pickups with balanced tonal range and vocal quality.

Anchored by PRS’s patented Gen III tremolo and Phase III tuners with wing buttons the Custom 24 is known for its playability, versatility, and tuning stability.

The Custom 24 is outfitted with PRS DMO treble and bass pickups with volume and tone controls and a 5-way blade switch. DMO (Dynamic, Musical, Open) pickups were personally designed by Paul Reed Smith and the PRS New Products Engineering team. From our own hands-on research into coveted vintage pickup models to advancements in signal analyzation and “tuning” technology, these pickups incorporate every detail of pickup knowledge PRS has gained in recent years of R&D.

PRS DMO pickups have a “wide open” sound with vocal character, meaning they deliver clear, pleasant-sounding tones across a wide range of frequencies (bass to treble) in each pickup.

The Custom 24 is the quintessential PRS guitar. This iconic instrument was the first model that Paul Reed Smith brought to the public at PRS Guitars’ first Winter NAMM show in 1985 and has been a top seller ever since.

# Custom 24-08

# Updated Icon

The Custom 24 is the quintessential PRS guitar, the iconic instrument that started it all back in 1985. The Custom 24-08 keeps many of the foundational specs as the original Custom – maple top, mahogany back and neck, 24 frets, 25” scale length, the PRS patented Gen III tremolo, and Phase III tuners with wing buttons – but adds a new level of versatility with its TCI pickups and EQ Mini-toggle switches.

TCI pickups are designed to offer a full, musical sound reminiscent of single-coil and soapbar tones. The dual EQ mini-toggle switches act as tuned high-pass filters when engaged (in the up position), removing shelved low-end and allowing the high frequencies through for more clarity and musical highs.

For classic PRS playability, reliability, and tone with ultimate flexibility, check out the Custom 24-08.

### PRS Patented Tremolo, Gen III

### PRS Phase III Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

### PRS TCI Pickups

# Custom 24 Piezo

# Electric & Acoustic Tones

The Custom 24 Piezo is a 24-fret solidbody piezo-equipped guitar that effortlessly achieves classic humbucker tones and authentic acoustic sounds in one instrument. With classic PRS appointments, including a figured maple top, mahogany back, 24-fret, 25” scale length mahogany neck with rosewood fretboard, PRS’s patented Gen III tremolo, and Phase III tuners with wing buttons, the Custom 24 Piezo is a unique tool for musicians in the writing room, the studio, and on the stage.

The Custom 24 Piezo boasts PRS DMO treble and bass pickups. PRS’s DMO (Dynamic, Musical, Open) pickups were personally designed by Paul Reed Smith and the PRS New Products Engineering team. From our own hands-on research into coveted vintage pickup models to advancements in signal analyzation and “tuning” technology, these pickups incorporate every detail of pickup knowledge PRS has gained in recent years of R&D. PRS DMO pickups have a “wide open” sound with vocal character, meaning they deliver clear, pleasant-sounding tones across a wide range of frequencies (bass to treble) in each pickup.

Equipped with the traditional volume/tone/5-way blade switch, this model also features a 3-way selector to switch between or blend the magnetic pickups and piezo electronics. The two output jacks allow guitarists to plug into their favorite electric or acoustic guitar amp or DI into a soundboard. By utilizing the separate blend control, the tone of the PRS DMO pickups can also be combined with the piezo acoustic sounds through a single output. With a nearly infinite range of tones, the Custom 24 Piezo is a perfect “go-to” guitar for players of all kinds.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo, Gen III

Meticulous design delivering sonic fidelity, player ergonomics, and revolutionary tuning stability.

### PRS Phase III Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

Modern locking technology with vintage elegance, these lightweight tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS DMO Pickups

“Dynamic, Musical, Open” pickups with balanced tonal range and vocal quality.

## Accolades

"The Custom 24 Piezo is without a doubt the best and most versatile guitar I have ever owned. I play them every night live. The piezo system gives us that acoustic sound that we’ve been wanting for years. Our FOH soundman loves them and it makes us sound better without a doubt. I didn’t do any alterations to the specs either. It was perfect right out of the case.”

- Mikael Akerfeldt (Opeth)

# Custom 24 Piezo

# Electric & Acoustic Tones

The Custom 24 Piezo is a 24-fret solidbody piezo-equipped guitar that effortlessly achieves classic humbucker tones and authentic acoustic sounds in one instrument. With classic PRS appointments, including a figured maple top, mahogany back, 24-fret, 25” scale length mahogany neck with rosewood fretboard, PRS’s patented Gen III tremolo, and Phase III tuners with wing buttons, the Custom 24 Piezo is a unique tool for musicians in the writing room, the studio, and on the stage.

The Custom 24 Piezo boasts PRS DMO treble and bass pickups. PRS’s DMO (Dynamic, Musical, Open) pickups were personally designed by Paul Reed Smith and the PRS New Products Engineering team. From our own hands-on research into coveted vintage pickup models to advancements in signal analyzation and “tuning” technology, these pickups incorporate every detail of pickup knowledge PRS has gained in recent years of R&D. PRS DMO pickups have a “wide open” sound with vocal character, meaning they deliver clear, pleasant-sounding tones across a wide range of frequencies (bass to treble) in each pickup.

Equipped with the traditional volume/tone/5-way blade switch, this model also features a 3-way selector to switch between or blend the magnetic pickups and piezo electronics. The two output jacks allow guitarists to plug into their favorite electric or acoustic guitar amp or DI into a soundboard. By utilizing the separate blend control, the tone of the PRS DMO pickups can also be combined with the piezo acoustic sounds through a single output. With a nearly infinite range of tones, the Custom 24 Piezo is a perfect “go-to” guitar for players of all kinds.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo, Gen III

Meticulous design delivering sonic fidelity, player ergonomics, and revolutionary tuning stability.

### PRS Phase III Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

Modern locking technology with vintage elegance, these lightweight tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS DMO Pickups

“Dynamic, Musical, Open” pickups with balanced tonal range and vocal quality.

## Accolades

"The Custom 24 Piezo is without a doubt the best and most versatile guitar I have ever owned. I play them every night live. The piezo system gives us that acoustic sound that we’ve been wanting for years. Our FOH soundman loves them and it makes us sound better without a doubt. I didn’t do any alterations to the specs either. It was perfect right out of the case.”

- Mikael Akerfeldt (Opeth)

# 40th Anniversary Custom 24 Limited Edition

# Celebrating The One That Started It All

Introducing the 40th Anniversary Custom 24 Limited Edition, celebrating four decades of PRS Guitars. Limited to 400 pieces worldwide, this special edition features both traditional design features and new appointments, making it an essential piece for serious musicians and collectors alike.

Built on the tried-and-true foundation of a mahogany back and neck with artist grade maple top, the 40th Anniversary Custom 24 boasts a retro violin top carve, PRS “Old School” birds with outlines, and PRS “Pre-Factory” headstock eagle, all of which pay homage to early PRS guitars. Outside of these aesthetic attributes, the 40th Anniversary Custom 24 is looking ahead with its all-new PRS DMO Treble and Bass pickups. DMO pickups (DMO standing for Dynamic, Musical, Open) were spec’d by Paul Reed Smith and the PRS New Products Engineering team to have a wide open sound with vocal character.

Other classic Custom 24 appointments include the PRS Gen III patented tremolo, PRS Phase III locking tuners with wing buttons, and PRS Signature 10-46 strings. This limited edition also features a ziricote fretboard and headstock veneer.

This commemorative run kicks off a year-long 40th Anniversary celebration for PRS Guitars. Only 400 of this 40th Anniversary Custom 24 Limited Edition will be available. Hand-signed 40th Anniversary certificate included.

# 40th Anniversary Custom 24-08 Semi-Hollow Limited Edition

# Expansive. Expressive. Elevated.

Introducing the 40th Anniversary Custom 24-08 Semi-Hollow Limited Edition, celebrating four decades of PRS Guitars. The Custom 24-08 keeps many of the foundational specs as the original Custom – the guitar that started PRS back in 1985 – but adds a new level of versatility with its TCI pickups and EQ mini-toggle switches. This limited-edition instrument also features a semi-hollow body, ziricote fretboard and headstock veneer, and special inlay package.

The 40th Anniversary Custom 24-08 Semi-Hollow Limited Edition starts with a “10-top” grade figured maple top, mahogany back and neck, and a ziricote fretboard. This wood combination, along with our thorough wood drying processes, creates a stable and resonant foundation. The addition of semi-hollow construction adds an even fuller organic quality to the tone, while the f-hole also adds an elegant visual touch.

Now made with American alnico and updated build specs, TCI pickups are designed to offer a full, musical sound reminiscent of single-coil and soapbar tones. The dual EQ mini-toggle switches act as tuned high-pass filters when engaged (in the up position), removing shelved low-end and allowing the high frequencies through for more clarity and musical highs.

“The EQ switches were developed with and first featured on the Private Stock John McLaughlin model in 2023. Both John and I felt that they offered a different, but just as versatile, sound that played a significant role in the musicality of that guitar. I am happy that we are now extending this feature into more models.” – Paul Reed Smith

Additional specifications for this instrument include a 24-fret, 25” scale length neck with “old school” birds with outlines designed to feel like home from the moment you pick it up, the PRS Gen III patented tremolo so you can flutter and divebomb, and Phase III locking tuners with wing buttons to keep you in tune without dulling your sound.

Limited to 300 pieces worldwide, this special edition features both traditional design features and new appointments, making it an essential piece for serious musicians and collectors alike. Only 300 of this 40th Anniversary Custom 24-08 Semi-Hollow Limited Edition will be available. Hand-signed 40th Anniversary certificate included.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo, Gen III

Meticulous design delivering sonic fidelity, player ergonomics, and revolutionary tuning stability.

### PRS Phase III Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

Modern locking technology with vintage elegance, these lightweight tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS TCI Pickups

Musical pickups that offer versatile tones from spanky singlecoils to full soapbars.

# 40th Anniversary Custom 24 Satin Limited Edition

# A New Twist on a Classic

The 40th Anniversary Custom 24 Satin Limited Edition celebrates four decades of PRS Guitars by bringing some new and noteworthy features to the model that started it all. Limited to 500 pieces worldwide, this special edition uniquely features a mango top, ebony fretboard, satin nitro finish, and smoked black hardware for a new twist on a classic.

Most notably, this limited edition exchanges the Custom 24’s classic maple for a striking figured mango top. Mango wood retains much of the sound characteristics as maple while bringing an almost “quilted” look to these guitars. The satin nitro finish adds to the guitar’s unique aesthetic appeal by bringing a more natural vibe to the instrument – along with great feel and resonant tone. The ebony fretboard and headstock veneer feature PRS “Old School” birds with outlines and a PRS “Pre-Factory” eagle on the headstock, which both pay homage to early PRS guitars.

While the guitar may look different, it boasts many of the Custom 24’s beloved features, including a mahogany back and neck, 25” scale length, 24 frets, 10” fretboard radius, and Pattern Thin shape. Other classic Custom 24 appointments include the PRS Gen III patented tremolo, PRS Phase III locking tuners with wing buttons, and PRS Signature 10-46 strings. The 40th Anniversary Custom 24 Satin Limited Edition is equipped with PRS’s DMO Treble and Bass pickups. DMO pickups (DMO standing for Dynamic, Musical, Open) were spec’d by Paul Reed Smith and the PRS New Products Engineering team to have a wide-open sound with vocal character. Paired with a 5-way blade switch, these pickups give players plenty of tonal range in their dual octave package.

This commemorative run continues PRS’s year-long 40th Anniversary celebration. Only 500 of this 40th Anniversary Custom 24 Satin Limited Edition will be available. Hand-signed 40th Anniversary certificate included.

# 40th Anniversary McCarty SC56 Limited Edition

# Vintage Soul. Modern Precision.

The 40th Anniversary PRS McCarty SC56 Limited Edition captures the essence of a golden era of electric guitar design while delivering the playability and reliability that today’s musicians demand. With a classic PRS single-cutaway body shape and carefully chosen specifications, the McCarty SC56 is both a tribute to tradition and a modern performer’s dream. Anchored by a maple top and mahogany back, with a 22-fret, 24.594” scale length Pattern Vintage neck, the McCarty SC56 is designed for rich, resonant tone and effortless playability. The 24.594” scale length and slightly thicker back give the McCarty SC56 a warm, woody voice and comfortable feel, while its Phase III non-locking tuners and PRS two-piece bridge anchor the guitar and promote its musical sustain. The heart of the 40th Anniversary McCarty SC56 Limited Edition lies in its pickups: a pair of PRS McCarty III pickups, meticulously designed to deliver warm, clear tone with exceptional note separation and dynamics. Controlled by a simple and elegant layout — two volume controls, two tone controls, and a 3-way toggle on the upper bout — the McCarty SC56 keeps the player focused on feel and sound. With appointments like binding on the fretboard, classic bird inlays, and a vintage-inspired nitrocellulose finish, the 40th Anniversary McCarty SC56 Limited Edition blends heritage and innovation into a timeless instrument. Whether you’re chasing pure vintage tone or seeking a reliable stage companion, the McCarty SC56 stands ready. PRS 40th Anniversary McCarty SC56 – 400 Piece Limited Edition

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Two-Piece Bridge

Made of zinc and brass, this bridge has four contact points and added mass, enhancing the natural tone of the guitar and helping to create a more resonant instrument.

### PRS Phase III Non-Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

With vintage elegance, these lightweight tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS McCarty III Pickups

Vintage-inspired pickups that bring a vocal clarity to their full, warm tone.

### Weight-Relief Design

Single-cutaway guitars are known to be heavier than their double-cutaway counterparts. This design incorporates weight-relief, decreasing the weight of the guitar by about 2/3 of a pound, while maintaining several points of attachment between the guitar top and back to eliminate the “hollow” sound of the cavities and promote tone transfer.

# 40th Anniversary McCarty SC56 Limited Edition

# Vintage Soul. Modern Precision.

The 40th Anniversary PRS McCarty SC56 Limited Edition captures the essence of a golden era of electric guitar design while delivering the playability and reliability that today’s musicians demand. With a classic PRS single-cutaway body shape and carefully chosen specifications, the McCarty SC56 is both a tribute to tradition and a modern performer’s dream. Anchored by a maple top and mahogany back, with a 22-fret, 24.594” scale length Pattern Vintage neck, the McCarty SC56 is designed for rich, resonant tone and effortless playability. The 24.594” scale length and slightly thicker back give the McCarty SC56 a warm, woody voice and comfortable feel, while its Phase III non-locking tuners and PRS two-piece bridge anchor the guitar and promote its musical sustain. The heart of the 40th Anniversary McCarty SC56 Limited Edition lies in its pickups: a pair of PRS McCarty III pickups, meticulously designed to deliver warm, clear tone with exceptional note separation and dynamics. Controlled by a simple and elegant layout — two volume controls, two tone controls, and a 3-way toggle on the upper bout — the McCarty SC56 keeps the player focused on feel and sound. With appointments like binding on the fretboard, classic bird inlays, and a vintage-inspired nitrocellulose finish, the 40th Anniversary McCarty SC56 Limited Edition blends heritage and innovation into a timeless instrument. Whether you’re chasing pure vintage tone or seeking a reliable stage companion, the McCarty SC56 stands ready. PRS 40th Anniversary McCarty SC56 – 400 Piece Limited Edition

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Two-Piece Bridge

Made of zinc and brass, this bridge has four contact points and added mass, enhancing the natural tone of the guitar and helping to create a more resonant instrument.

### PRS Phase III Non-Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

With vintage elegance, these lightweight tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS McCarty III Pickups

Vintage-inspired pickups that bring a vocal clarity to their full, warm tone.

### Weight-Relief Design

Single-cutaway guitars are known to be heavier than their double-cutaway counterparts. This design incorporates weight-relief, decreasing the weight of the guitar by about 2/3 of a pound, while maintaining several points of attachment between the guitar top and back to eliminate the “hollow” sound of the cavities and promote tone transfer.

# McCarty

# A Legacy of Innovation

Named after Ted McCarty, a pioneer of the electric guitar and musical instrument industry, the McCarty model embodies the most up-to-date findings from PRS and looks back to the golden age of the guitar. This vintage-appointed guitar features a bound, 22-fret Pattern neck and a slightly thicker back for enhanced tone and sustain. The PRS McCarty model is anchored by a stoptail bridge with brass inserts and non-locking PRS Phase III tuners with brass shafts for added resonance and sustain.

The PRS McCarty is outfitted with McCarty III treble and bass pickups. McCarty III pickups were spec’d by Paul Reed Smith and the PRS New Products Engineering team. From our own hands-on research into coveted vintage pickup models to advancements in signal analyzation and “tuning” technology, these pickups incorporate every detail of pickup knowledge PRS has gained in recent years of R&D. PRS McCarty III pickups are vintage-inspired humbuckers that bring a vocal clarity to their full, warm tone. Paired with a push/pull tone control and a 3-way toggle pickup switch, these pickups provide a complete palette of tones.

In the late 1980’s, Paul Reed Smith called on Ted McCarty to consult with him on guitar design and production techniques. He not only served as a mentor but became a great friend of Paul and everyone he met at PRS. In 1994, PRS released the first McCarty, an instrument that incorporated the full spectrum of techniques and knowledge Paul had gained from Ted as well as Paul’s own experiences as a guitar builder.

The McCarty 594 is a versatile, vintage-inspired instrument with modern playability and reliability. Featuring a bound 22-fret Pattern Vintage neck and slightly thicker back for more enhanced tone and sustain, the McCarty 594 plays in tune, is intonated the entire length of the neck, and feels like a guitar you’ve been playing forever. Whether you are looking for rich, authentic humbucking tones or nuanced, sweet single-coil sounds, the McCarty 594 can seamlessly master both sonic territories thanks to its McCarty III pickups and dual volume and push/pull tone controls.

McCarty III pickups were spec’d by Paul Reed Smith and the PRS New Products Engineering team. From our own hands-on research into coveted vintage pickup models to advancements in signal analyzation and “tuning” technology, these pickups incorporate every detail of pickup knowledge PRS has gained in recent years of R&D. PRS McCarty III pickups are vintage-inspired humbuckers that bring a vocal clarity to their full, warm tone. A zinc two-piece bridge with brass saddles and steel studs, bone nut, and PRS Phase III tuners with brass shafts anchor this guitar and stay true to the promise of the McCarty family.

“One of my sayings is that everything that touches the string is God – well, that’s really the bridge, the nut, and the tuners. These specifications make a huge difference in the guitar’s tone, sustain, and character.” – Paul Reed Smith.

In the late 1980’s, Paul Reed Smith called on Ted McCarty to consult with him on guitar design and production techniques. He not only served as a mentor but became a great friend of Paul and everyone he met at PRS. In 1994, PRS released the first McCarty, an instrument that incorporated the full spectrum of techniques and knowledge Paul had gained from Ted as well as his own experiences as a guitar builder.

## Accolades

"The 594 is the best new guitar I've played in years. It has a vintage heart and soul but without the technical limitations that usually come along with an old instrument. What good is an old guitar if you can't get all that feel out of the upper frets, or the intonation is off? To hear that old PAF sound but be able to articulate the notes in a way that only modern manufacturing could allow is so exciting."

- John Mayer

"It's engineered beautifully and really lives up to the idea of getting the best attributes of an old instrument, I love the two volume/two tone layout, while still keeping the overall feel of a PRS. The pickups sound great and really have the vibe of old PAF's that aren't wound too hot."

- Jimmy Herring, Widespread Panic

"I could go on and on about how fabulous this thing sounds, how beautifully it plays and intonates, the exquisite workmanship, etc. Instead let me just say that I’ve played a lot of guitars in general and PRS guitars in particular...and this is one of the finest instruments I have ever encountered."

- Guitar Player

"The new McCarty 594 is extremely versatile. With individual volume, tone and coil tap pulls I’m able to create a wide enough variety of tones that it has minimized my guitar changes on this year’s Toby Keith Interstates & Tailgates tour to almost none!"

- Rich Eckhardt, Toby Keith

"So... you guys knocked this one out of the park. It’s... kinda freaking me out a bit. Causing me to re-think my touring set and I have only been playing it for two hours. I am not really sure what to say, I have two “Holy Grail” guitars that do most of my heavy lifting in the set, but this one is going to be banging it’s head to work its way in. I am a bit stunned. The 594 sounded like a good concept on paper, but....just wow. This is a killer."

- John Wesley Dearth, Porcupine Tree

# McCarty 594 Hollowbody II

# Timeless Resonance

The McCarty 594 Hollowbody II brings a new set of features to one of our most beloved models: the Hollowbody II. With fully-hollow construction, the Hollowbody II is a resonant guitar with warm, woody tone. The details carried over from the McCarty 594 model impart even more vintage character to this already classic instrument. McCarty III pickups ensure that these guitars are clear and musical while dual volume and push/pull tone controls offer plenty of versatility with both humbucking and single-coil tones on tap.

McCarty III pickups were spec’d by Paul Reed Smith and the PRS New Products Engineering team. From our own hands-on research into coveted vintage pickup models to advancements in signal analyzation and “tuning” technology, these pickups incorporate every detail of pickup knowledge PRS has gained in recent years of R&D. PRS McCarty III pickups are vintage-inspired humbuckers that bring a vocal clarity to their full, warm tone. A zinc two-piece bridge with brass saddles and steel studs, bone nut, and PRS Phase III tuners with brass shafts anchor this guitar and stay true to the promise of the McCarty family.

Whether you are looking for rich, authentic humbucking tones or nuanced, sweet single-coil sounds, the McCarty 594 Hollowbody II will oblige with warmth and resonance. Additional appointments include, a bound, 22-fret, 24.594” scale length Pattern Vintage neck with rosewood fretboard and PRS trademark bird inlays.

In the late 1980’s, Paul Reed Smith called on Ted McCarty to consult with him on guitar design and production techniques. He not only served as a mentor but became a great friend of Paul and everyone he met at PRS. In 1994, PRS released the first McCarty, an instrument that incorporated the full spectrum of techniques and knowledge Paul had gained from Ted as well as his own experiences as a guitar builder.

# McCarty 594 Hollowbody II

# Timeless Resonance

The McCarty 594 Hollowbody II brings a new set of features to one of our most beloved models: the Hollowbody II. With fully-hollow construction, the Hollowbody II is a resonant guitar with warm, woody tone. The details carried over from the McCarty 594 model impart even more vintage character to this already classic instrument. McCarty III pickups ensure that these guitars are clear and musical while dual volume and push/pull tone controls offer plenty of versatility with both humbucking and single-coil tones on tap.

McCarty III pickups were spec’d by Paul Reed Smith and the PRS New Products Engineering team. From our own hands-on research into coveted vintage pickup models to advancements in signal analyzation and “tuning” technology, these pickups incorporate every detail of pickup knowledge PRS has gained in recent years of R&D. PRS McCarty III pickups are vintage-inspired humbuckers that bring a vocal clarity to their full, warm tone. A zinc two-piece bridge with brass saddles and steel studs, bone nut, and PRS Phase III tuners with brass shafts anchor this guitar and stay true to the promise of the McCarty family.

Whether you are looking for rich, authentic humbucking tones or nuanced, sweet single-coil sounds, the McCarty 594 Hollowbody II will oblige with warmth and resonance. Additional appointments include, a bound, 22-fret, 24.594” scale length Pattern Vintage neck with rosewood fretboard and PRS trademark bird inlays.

In the late 1980’s, Paul Reed Smith called on Ted McCarty to consult with him on guitar design and production techniques. He not only served as a mentor but became a great friend of Paul and everyone he met at PRS. In 1994, PRS released the first McCarty, an instrument that incorporated the full spectrum of techniques and knowledge Paul had gained from Ted as well as his own experiences as a guitar builder.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Two-Piece Bridge

Made of zinc and brass, this bridge has four contact points and added mass, enhancing the natural tone of the guitar and helping to create a more resonant instrument.

### PRS Phase III Non-Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

With vintage elegance, these lightweight tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS McCarty III Pickups

Vintage-inspired pickups that bring a vocal clarity to their full, warm tone.

# Standard 24 Satin

# Raise Your Standards

The PRS Standard harkens back to Paul Reed Smith’s pre-factory all-mahogany guitars. Its all-mahogany construction promotes a warm, full, midrange-forward tone, and its “sinky” satin nitro finish brings a stripped-down look and roadworthy feel to the instrument.

The PRS Standard 24 features many classic PRS specifications, including a 25” scale length, Pattern Thin neck with a 24-fret, 10” radius rosewood fretboard, PRS Patented Tremolo, and PRS Phase III tuners with unplated brass shafts.

Under the hood, the PRS Standard 24 is outfitted with PRS DMO treble and bass pickups with volume and tone controls and a 5-way blade switch. PRS DMO (Dynamic, Musical, Open) pickups have a “wide open” sound with vocal character, meaning they deliver clear, pleasant-sounding tones across a wide range of frequencies (bass to treble) in each pickup. DMO pickups were personally designed by Paul Reed Smith and the PRS New Products Engineering team. From our own hands-on research into coveted vintage pickup models to advancements in signal analyzation and “tuning” technology, these pickups incorporate every detail of pickup knowledge PRS has gained in recent years of R&D.

Raise your standards with this stage- and studio-ready guitar.

# Hollowbody II Piezo

# Electric Power & Acoustic Resonance

With brilliant acoustics and a vast array of tones, the Hollowbody II has been a constant favorite in our dynamic lineup of hollow instruments. The combination of the maple top and back with mahogany sides provides tonal clarity and extraordinary resonance. While the 22-fret, 25” scale length neck delivers familiar comfort and playability.

Featuring PRS McCarty III pickups, the PRS Hollowbody II has a vintage-inspired voice with vocal clarity and full, warm tone. The LR Baggs/PRS Piezo System comes standard, providing musicians with the versatility of wielding both acoustic and electric guitar tones in one instrument. There are two output jacks on the Hollowbody II Piezo, allowing guitarists to plug into their favorite electric guitar or acoustic guitar amp or DI into a soundboard. By utilizing the separate blend control, the tone of the Hollowbody II Piezo's McCarty III pickups can also be combined with acoustic sounds through a single output.

With a nearly infinite range of resonant tones, the PRS Hollowbody II Piezo is a beautiful “go-to” guitar.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Adjustable 'Piezo' Stoptail

Including six individual piezo-equipped saddles, this bridge works with the LR Baggs/PRS proprietary piezo electronics, to effortlessly achieve electric and acoustic sounds in one instrument.

### PRS Phase III Non-Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

With vintage elegance, these lightweight tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS McCarty III Pickups

Vintage-inspired pickups that bring a vocal clarity to their full, warm tone.

## Accolades

"Want sustain and tone that just keeps going....and going....and going, long enough to make Nigel forget what he started? Look no further than the Paul Reed Smith Hollowbody II electric."

- American Songwriter

"CAMILA’s music often goes from soft acoustic guitar arpeggios to power chords and leads, all within the same song. The PRS Hollowbody is my essential tool for achieving those changes in a live situation. I just love the sound of the Piezo and the Humbuckers. I even combine both sounds on some songs and the blend is beautiful. It’s like having two guitars in one. It quickly became my main axe."

- Pablo Hurtado, Camila

# Hollowbody II Piezo

# Electric Power & Acoustic Resonance

With brilliant acoustics and a vast array of tones, the Hollowbody II has been a constant favorite in our dynamic lineup of hollow instruments. The combination of the maple top and back with mahogany sides provides tonal clarity and extraordinary resonance. While the 22-fret, 25” scale length neck delivers familiar comfort and playability.

Featuring PRS McCarty III pickups, the PRS Hollowbody II has a vintage-inspired voice with vocal clarity and full, warm tone. The LR Baggs/PRS Piezo System comes standard, providing musicians with the versatility of wielding both acoustic and electric guitar tones in one instrument. There are two output jacks on the Hollowbody II Piezo, allowing guitarists to plug into their favorite electric guitar or acoustic guitar amp or DI into a soundboard. By utilizing the separate blend control, the tone of the Hollowbody II Piezo's McCarty III pickups can also be combined with acoustic sounds through a single output.

With a nearly infinite range of resonant tones, the PRS Hollowbody II Piezo is a beautiful “go-to” guitar.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Adjustable 'Piezo' Stoptail

Including six individual piezo-equipped saddles, this bridge works with the LR Baggs/PRS proprietary piezo electronics, to effortlessly achieve electric and acoustic sounds in one instrument.

### PRS Phase III Non-Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

With vintage elegance, these lightweight tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS McCarty III Pickups

Vintage-inspired pickups that bring a vocal clarity to their full, warm tone.

## Accolades

"Want sustain and tone that just keeps going....and going....and going, long enough to make Nigel forget what he started? Look no further than the Paul Reed Smith Hollowbody II electric."

- American Songwriter

"CAMILA’s music often goes from soft acoustic guitar arpeggios to power chords and leads, all within the same song. The PRS Hollowbody is my essential tool for achieving those changes in a live situation. I just love the sound of the Piezo and the Humbuckers. I even combine both sounds on some songs and the blend is beautiful. It’s like having two guitars in one. It quickly became my main axe."

- Pablo Hurtado, Camila

# 40th Anniversary Special Semi-Hollow Limited Edition

# Versatility, Elevated.

The 40th Anniversary Special Semi-Hollow Limited Edition marries PRS innovation with distinct wood appointments to bring players an incredible amount of versatility in a unique package. Limited to just 280 pieces worldwide, this special edition features PRS’s McCarty III treble and bass pickups with a proprietary PRS Narrowfield in the center position along with an artist grade figured maple top, black limba back and neck, and Honduran rosewood fretboard and headstock veneer.

The PRS Special Semi-Hollow delivers twelve pickup combinations to players, thanks to the three-pickup configuration paired with a 5-way blade and two mini-toggles. Roll back the tone control for added growl, turn it up for some shimmer, and have fun exploring this versatile tonal palette. The volume level between the humbucking and single-coil settings remains very even, and the semi-hollow body with single f-hole provides welcome airiness and depth to the guitar’s tone.

Other classic appointments include a 25” scale length, 22 frets, 10” fretboard radius, and Pattern neck shape. The PRS “Old School” birds inlays with outlines and a PRS “Pre-Factory” eagle on the headstock both pay homage to early PRS guitars. The PRS Gen III patented tremolo, PRS Phase III locking tuners with wing buttons, and PRS Signature 10-46 strings round out the specs.

This commemorative run continues PRS’s year-long 40th Anniversary celebration. Only 280 of this 40th Anniversary Special Semi-Hollow Limited Edition will be available. Hand-signed 40th Anniversary certificate included.

### PRS Patented Tremolo, Gen III

# Special Semi-Hollow

# Explore Your Sound

The PRS Special Semi-Hollow offers players a versatile hum/”single”/hum configuration with two PRS McCarty III humbuckers and a PRS Narrowfield middle pickup.

McCarty III pickups were spec’d by Paul Reed Smith and the PRS New Products Engineering team. From our own hands-on research into coveted vintage pickup models to advancements in signal analyzation and “tuning” technology, these pickups incorporate every detail of pickup knowledge PRS has gained in recent years of R&D. PRS McCarty III pickups are vintage-inspired humbuckers that bring a vocal clarity to their full, warm tone. PRS Narrowfield pickup in the middle position delivers the bite of a single coil, so it cuts through the mix with plenty of clarity and punch – but without the hum.

Paired with a 5-way blade switch and two mini-toggles that tap the McCarty III humbuckers, this guitar can handle myriad sounds and styles (with twelve pickup combinations in total). Roll back the tone control for added growl, turn it up for some shimmer, and have fun exploring this versatile tonal palette. The volume level between the humbucking and single-coil settings remains very even, and the semi-hollow body with single f-hole provides a welcome airiness and depth to the guitar’s tone.

Additional specifications on the PRS Special Semi-Hollow include a maple top, mahogany back, 22-fret 25” scale length mahogany neck, rosewood fretboard, Phase III locking tuners with wing buttons, and the PRS Gen III patented tremolo.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo, Gen III

Meticulous design delivering sonic fidelity, player ergonomics, and revolutionary tuning stability.

### PRS Phase III Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

Modern locking technology with vintage elegance, these lightweight tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### Hum/NF/Hum

Myriad sounds and styles with twelve total pickup configurations.

# Desert Island Tone & Versatility

The PRS Studio model is a modern take on a traditional single-single-hum guitar, with PRS’s proprietary Narrowfield pickups in the middle and bass positions and a McCarty III humbucking treble pickup. McCarty III pickups were spec’d by Paul Reed Smith and the PRS New Products Engineering team after years of hands-on research with coveted vintage pickup models and advancements in signal analyzation and “tuning” technology. PRS McCarty III pickups are vintage-inspired humbuckers that bring a vocal clarity to their full, warm tone.

The PRS Studio offers punchy singlecoils, vintage scooped tones, and the chunky kick of a treble humbucker screaming in one instrument. This whole new scope of sounds are only possible with a three-pickup guitar and are easily accessible in the Studio model thanks to the push/pull tone control and 5-way blade switch. With seven combinations in all, the PRS Studio covers classic tones but maintains a unique voice making it a perfect “desert island” guitar.

Other specifications include a maple top, mahogany back and neck, and a rosewood, 22-fret, 25” scale length fretboard with PRS trademark bird inlays. The PRS Studio is anchored by PRS’s patented Gen III trem and Phase IIl Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons, both designed for excellent tuning stability while maximizing the transfer of the strings’ vibration through the instrument.

### PRS Patented Tremolo, Gen III

## Accolades

"It sounds to us less about copping the sound of a '60s Strat with a hot PAF at the bridge, and more about offering a broad spectrum of fully hum-cancelling voices that sound classy and sophisticated played clean and really quite huge but defined with some crunch and gain. Factor in the feel, the neck shape and the ergonomics and it’s like the best vintage guitar you’ve never owned, certainly not at this price anyway."

## Accolades

"It sounds to us less about copping the sound of a '60s Strat with a hot PAF at the bridge, and more about offering a broad spectrum of fully hum-cancelling voices that sound classy and sophisticated played clean and really quite huge but defined with some crunch and gain. Factor in the feel, the neck shape and the ergonomics and it’s like the best vintage guitar you’ve never owned, certainly not at this price anyway."

# Modern Eagle V

# Celebration of Tone

“Modern Eagle models have always been built to stand up to history while celebrating tonewoods and the discovery of new tones. The Modern Eagle V is a sophisticated instrument not only in its craftsmanship but in its electronic and mechanical design,” said Paul Reed Smith.

The Modern Eagle V offers highly musical tones for both recording and playing live. A mix of classic and modern, the Modern Eagle V is built on a tried-and-true foundation of a maple top and mahogany back, a 22 fret, 25” scale length, Pattern mahogany neck with rosewood fretboard, bone nut, PRS Phase III Tuners, and the PRS patented Gen III tremolo. Its innovative pickup and electronics configuration puts a wide range of tones at your fingertips.

Utilizing a hum/single/hum (five-coil) pickup layout and unique electronics configuration, the Modern Eagle V gives players a vast array of tones in one guitar. The 5-way blade switch selects the pickups in intuitive groupings: treble, treble and middle, middle, middle and bass, and bass. There is a single volume and a push/pull tone control that activates both humbuckers when engaged; this allows players to access all three pickups simultaneously. Finally, the dual EQ mini-toggle switches act as tuned high-pass filters when engaged (in the up position), removing shelved low-end and allowing the high frequencies through for more clarity and musical highs.

# DGT

# Vintage Tone Out Of The Box

“The DGT is a product a lot of miles down the road: a lot of gigs, a lot of records. It’s like picking up a vintage guitar. It sounds like a vintage guitar, and out of the box it’s ready to go. There’s a whole lot of thought gone into this. The DGT is pretty perfect to me.” – David Grissom

The DGT (David Grissom Trem) is the result of more than 20 years of collaboration between Paul Reed Smith and David Grissom. The DGT is based on the McCarty platform with a unique DGT neck shape, taller frets, specially-voiced pickups, and a revised control layout. Grissom and Paul spent a year A/B-ing more than forty sets of pickups before nailing the vintage-voice of DGT humbuckers. When paired with individual volume controls for each pickup and a push/pull master tone control that operates the coil taps, DGT pickups provide versatility and articulation.

An ultimate expression of a player’s guitar.

# DGT

# Vintage Tone Out Of The Box

“The DGT is a product a lot of miles down the road: a lot of gigs, a lot of records. It’s like picking up a vintage guitar. It sounds like a vintage guitar, and out of the box it’s ready to go. There’s a whole lot of thought gone into this. The DGT is pretty perfect to me.” – David Grissom

The DGT (David Grissom Trem) is the result of more than 20 years of collaboration between Paul Reed Smith and David Grissom. The DGT is based on the McCarty platform with a unique DGT neck shape, taller frets, specially-voiced pickups, and a revised control layout. Grissom and Paul spent a year A/B-ing more than forty sets of pickups before nailing the vintage-voice of DGT humbuckers. When paired with individual volume controls for each pickup and a push/pull master tone control that operates the coil taps, DGT pickups provide versatility and articulation.

An ultimate expression of a player’s guitar.

# Mark Tremonti Signature

# Aggressive, Articulate Tone

Mark Tremonti is one of rock’s leading guitarists. As the guitarist of Alter Bridge and Creed, he has met extraordinary success and continues to grow as both a guitar player and songwriter. While Creed was on tour in support of their first record, My Own Prison, Mark was contacted by PRS and asked if he would like to try one of their guitars.

"I jumped at the idea to play one of PRS’ guitars. PRS was one of those guitars that I could never afford in high school or college and had always wanted to play one." PRS sent Mark a McCarty model which he instantly fell in love with. He played that guitar exclusively for a while, but ultimately wanted a guitar that was more suited to his playing style.

Mark Tremonti began to collaborate with PRS on his dream guitar that would soon become the Mark Tremonti Signature. He needed pickups that were a little more aggressive and could complement his rhythm playing which contains a lot of palm muting. The neck of the guitar needed to accommodate his style, influenced by thrash metal, shred, and traditional blues. PRS met these needs with the Tremonti neck carve.

# Santana Retro

# Celebrating History

Carlos Santana’s longstanding creative partnership with Paul Reed Smith has done much to shape the destiny of PRS Guitars. Over the years, we have honored this pivotal alliance by offering variations of his signature model instrument. The Santana Retro pays homage to the early “Pre-Factory” guitars Paul built for Carlos in the early 1980’s. Several unique design elements are reintroduced on this model, including a deeper body carve, original style heel, and the original headstock shape and nut placement. The Santana Retro blends history and modern manufacturing to create a highly musical guitar good enough for the man himself.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo, Gen III

Meticulous design delivering sonic fidelity, player ergonomics, and revolutionary tuning stability.

### PRS Phase III Locking Tuners

Modern locking technology with vintage elegance, these tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS Santana Pickups

Vintage-flavor pickups that deliver legendary clear, smooth tone.

# Santana Retro

# Celebrating History

Carlos Santana’s longstanding creative partnership with Paul Reed Smith has done much to shape the destiny of PRS Guitars. Over the years, we have honored this pivotal alliance by offering variations of his signature model instrument. The Santana Retro pays homage to the early “Pre-Factory” guitars Paul built for Carlos in the early 1980’s. Several unique design elements are reintroduced on this model, including a deeper body carve, original style heel, and the original headstock shape and nut placement. The Santana Retro blends history and modern manufacturing to create a highly musical guitar good enough for the man himself.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo, Gen III

Meticulous design delivering sonic fidelity, player ergonomics, and revolutionary tuning stability.

### PRS Phase III Locking Tuners

Modern locking technology with vintage elegance, these tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS Santana Pickups

Vintage-flavor pickups that deliver legendary clear, smooth tone.

# Chleo Limited Edition

# Unleash the Dragon

“With the PRS Chleo, I wanted to create a guitar that combined effortless playability, precision craftsmanship, and a versatile tonal range. It brings together modern innovation with timeless style, giving players the freedom to explore both classic sounds and new creative possibilities. The Chleo isn’t just a signature model — it’s a guitar built to inspire.” – Herman Li, DragonForce

Herman Li is an award-winning guitarist, songwriter, producer, and content creator, best known for his work as one of the lead guitar players in the power metal band DragonForce. As a guitar player who is as dedicated to understanding his instrument as he is to continually refining his craft as a player, Li was a formidable partner in designing his signature PRS. The initial result of this collaboration is the PRS Chleo Limited Edition, named by Li after his children. Only 200 of this instrument will be made in 2025.

At first glance, the Chleo is a seemingly dramatic departure from classic PRS design, but its craftsmanship and quality are wholly PRS. Featuring PRS’s tried-and-true combination of a mahogany back and figured maple top with a maple neck, the Chleo’s body shape and neck have been specially engineered for this model. The body has been modified in several ways from PRS’s traditional profile. Most notably, it is remarkably thin, making it light enough for high-energy stage performances and comfortable for longer gigs. The neck shape and neck joint were specially designed to be comfortable and fast, and with glow-in-the-dark side dots you’ll never lose your place. The neck is very thin front-to-back with a slightly taller playing surface and 20” fretboard radius, and the neck joint has added surface area to promote build integrity and tonal transfer. PRS’s trademark scoop has also been modified for ultimate access to the upper frets, and the last 4 frets are scalloped so you can dig into those notes with ease. If the Chleo wasn’t unmistakable already, its ebony fretboard features a unique “Eclipse Dragon” inlay pattern. Li’s Signature Series Fishman Fluence pickups are at the heart of the PRS Chleo. These copper-free pickups use layered PCBs for consistent, noise-free performance. With three distinct voices and a versatile switching system, the guitar offers up to 13 unique tone combinations. From fat, aggressive rhythm tones to smooth, warm leads, soaring screams, and crystal-clear single-coil sounds, these pickups cover it all. The performance-friendly control layout makes it easy to switch between tones on the fly. Whether you’re using high-gain tube amps, solid-state rigs, modern amp modelers, or DAW plugins, the Chleo’s pickups are built to shine across any setup. Adding to the innovation is a Gotoh locking tremolo system, enhanced with the new PRS Custom Stabilizer. It delivers the expressive freedom of a fully floating tremolo, while offering the tuning stability players love from fixed bridges, delivering confidence and control in any situation. Experience PRS quality in a boundary-pushing design with the PRS Chleo Limited Edition. PRS Chleo Limited Edition – Only 200 will be made in 2025.

These videos were created by our partners and friends. While many are not sponsored, some may feature paid partnerships. They all offer independent insights and reviews of our products.

## Featured Specifications

### Gotoh GE1996T Tremolo with PRS Stabilizer

This double-locking tremolo and PRS Custom Stabilizer combination means a fully floating bridge while maintaining exceptional tuning stability, even during aggressive tremolo use or string breakage. Expressive performance with reliable control.

### PRS Phase III Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

Modern locking technology with vintage elegance, these lightweight tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### Fishman Fluence Omniforce Pickups - Herman Li Signature

Featuring three distinct voices per pickup and a versatile switching system, the Omniforce set offers up to 13 tone combinations — from powerful high-output tones to articulate single-coil sounds. The middle single coil is designed to sit low against the body for improved picking comfort and tonal balance.

### PRS Chleo Ultimate Access Neck Joint

Reinforced neck joint with ultimate access to the upper frets works with any modern guitar techniques. Stress tested for stability and durability in the way only Herman Li can do. The last four frets are scalloped so you can dig in with ease.

# Kanami Limited Edition

# Maid to Rock

“PRS has always been an essential part of BAND-MAID’s sound ever since I started playing the Custom 24. When thinking about the specs of my signature model, the control layout of the Custom 24-08 was the best choice as a base, because many BAND-MAID songs require the high E note on the 24th fret, and I often switch between humbucker and single-coil sounds. As for the color finish, I chose Trampas Green Burst. This is the color of my first PRS I bought when I decided to become a professional guitarist with BAND-MAID. One of my dreams to have my own signature model has come true here, and I would say this guitar is an extension of my first PRS. What an honor it is!” – KANAMI // BAND-MAID

The PRS Kanami Limited Edition is the first signature model for Kanami Tono of Japan’s hard-rock band: Band-Maid. Kanami is Band-Maid’s lead guitarist and has been playing PRS for more than a decade. This limited edition is based off her most recent PRS Custom 24-08 guitar but, most notably, boasts PRS’s 85/15 humbuckers and PRS Brushstroke birds.

PRS 85/15 pickups offer exceptional clarity with a full range of tones. The two mini-toggle coil-tap switches allow for powerful humbucking and crisp single-coil sounds in one instrument…a must when playing leads in hard rock and metal. More of Kanami’s personal appointment choices include a quilted maple top, ebony fretboard with Brushstroke Bird inlays, and smoked black hardware. Kanami also chose the visually striking stain color: Trampas Green Smokeburst. Ready to travel to any gig, the PRS Kanami Limited Edition ships in the new PRS ATA multi-fit molded case.

This limited edition is hand-signed by Kanami on the guitar’s backplate. Only 200 of the PRS Kanami Limited Edition will be made.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo, Gen III

Meticulous design delivering sonic fidelity, player ergonomics, and revolutionary tuning stability.

### PRS Phase III Locking Tuners

# Chleo Limited Edition

# Unleash the Dragon

“With the PRS Chleo, I wanted to create a guitar that combined effortless playability, precision craftsmanship, and a versatile tonal range. It brings together modern innovation with timeless style, giving players the freedom to explore both classic sounds and new creative possibilities. The Chleo isn’t just a signature model — it’s a guitar built to inspire.” – Herman Li, DragonForce

Herman Li is an award-winning guitarist, songwriter, producer, and content creator, best known for his work as one of the lead guitar players in the power metal band DragonForce. As a guitar player who is as dedicated to understanding his instrument as he is to continually refining his craft as a player, Li was a formidable partner in designing his signature PRS. The initial result of this collaboration is the PRS Chleo Limited Edition, named by Li after his children. Only 200 of this instrument will be made in 2025.

At first glance, the Chleo is a seemingly dramatic departure from classic PRS design, but its craftsmanship and quality are wholly PRS. Featuring PRS’s tried-and-true combination of a mahogany back and figured maple top with a maple neck, the Chleo’s body shape and neck have been specially engineered for this model. The body has been modified in several ways from PRS’s traditional profile. Most notably, it is remarkably thin, making it light enough for high-energy stage performances and comfortable for longer gigs. The neck shape and neck joint were specially designed to be comfortable and fast, and with glow-in-the-dark side dots you’ll never lose your place. The neck is very thin front-to-back with a slightly taller playing surface and 20” fretboard radius, and the neck joint has added surface area to promote build integrity and tonal transfer. PRS’s trademark scoop has also been modified for ultimate access to the upper frets, and the last 4 frets are scalloped so you can dig into those notes with ease. If the Chleo wasn’t unmistakable already, its ebony fretboard features a unique “Eclipse Dragon” inlay pattern. Li’s Signature Series Fishman Fluence pickups are at the heart of the PRS Chleo. These copper-free pickups use layered PCBs for consistent, noise-free performance. With three distinct voices and a versatile switching system, the guitar offers up to 13 unique tone combinations. From fat, aggressive rhythm tones to smooth, warm leads, soaring screams, and crystal-clear single-coil sounds, these pickups cover it all. The performance-friendly control layout makes it easy to switch between tones on the fly. Whether you’re using high-gain tube amps, solid-state rigs, modern amp modelers, or DAW plugins, the Chleo’s pickups are built to shine across any setup. Adding to the innovation is a Gotoh locking tremolo system, enhanced with the new PRS Custom Stabilizer. It delivers the expressive freedom of a fully floating tremolo, while offering the tuning stability players love from fixed bridges, delivering confidence and control in any situation. Experience PRS quality in a boundary-pushing design with the PRS Chleo Limited Edition. PRS Chleo Limited Edition – Only 200 will be made in 2025.

## Featured Specifications

### Gotoh GE1996T Tremolo with PRS Stabilizer

This double-locking tremolo and PRS Custom Stabilizer combination means a fully floating bridge while maintaining exceptional tuning stability, even during aggressive tremolo use or string breakage. Expressive performance with reliable control.

### PRS Phase III Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

Modern locking technology with vintage elegance, these lightweight tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### Fishman Fluence Omniforce Pickups - Herman Li Signature

Featuring three distinct voices per pickup and a versatile switching system, the Omniforce set offers up to 13 tone combinations — from powerful high-output tones to articulate single-coil sounds. The middle single coil is designed to sit low against the body for improved picking comfort and tonal balance.

### PRS Chleo Ultimate Access Neck Joint

Reinforced neck joint with ultimate access to the upper frets works with any modern guitar techniques. Stress tested for stability and durability in the way only Herman Li can do. The last four frets are scalloped so you can dig in with ease.

# Charcoal Phoenix Limited Edition

# A Legacy Reborn

The PRS Charcoal Phoenix Limited Edition represents Paul Reed Smith’s current personal instrument choice as a guitar maker and a guitar player. Designed with meticulous attention to detail and crafted to celebrate PRS Guitars’ 40th Anniversary, this model is limited to only 150 pieces worldwide.

“When we released the Private Stock John McLaughlin Limited Edition in 2023, I was inspired by its exceptional sound and playability. For the Charcoal Phoenix, I wanted to create something equally remarkable but with a stoptail bridge. Using chaltecoco for the neck and ziricote for the fingerboard, I achieved an instrument that sustains beautifully and rings with clarity. The deep crimson back and the charcoal microburst top inspired the name ‘Charcoal Phoenix,’ evoking the imagery of a phoenix rising from fire and ashes.” – Paul Reed Smith

Over the past year, Paul has road-tested this guitar, refining its design and tone. The result is an instrument that delivers aesthetic arrest and unparalleled performance. A visually stunning deep crimson back contrasts beautifully with the Private Stock-grade figured maple top in a charcoal microburst finish. The ripple abalone “Old School” bird inlays on the ziricote fingerboard add a touch of vintage elegance. The Charcoal Phoenix also features the newly updated PRS TCI pickups for 2025 and EQ mini-toggle switches. The TCI pickups are crafted with American Alnico magnets and slightly modified winding, wiring, and electronics specifications. These pickups have a clear, beautiful tone based on Paul’s experience playing this guitar live and in the studio for more than a year. The EQ mini-toggles act as tuned high-pass filters when engaged, removing shelved low end and allowing the high frequencies through for more clarity and musical highs.

Introduced on Paul Reed Smith’s birthday, the PRS Charcoal Phoenix Limited Edition is part of PRS Guitars 40th Anniversary celebration. Only 150 of these instruments will be available. Hand-signed 40th Anniversary certificate included.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Stoptail w/ Brass Inserts & Steel Studs

Engineered with curved string slots with brass inserts and steel studs, this bridge is designed to maximize the transfer of the strings’ vibrations through the instrument.

### PRS Phase III Non-Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

With vintage elegance, these lightweight tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS TCI Pickups

Musical pickups that offer versatile tones from spanky single coils to full soapbars. Made with American Alnico in Stevensville, Maryland.

# CE 24

# Addictive Bolt-on Tone & Feel

Since the dawn of rock and roll, the snap and response that comes from a bolt-on neck guitar has been an essential part of the mix. These attributes have, in turn, become essential to many players trying to tell their story through music. The CE 24 pairs PRS’s traditional body combination of the mahogany back and maple top with a bolt-on maple neck and rosewood fretboard. The neck sports a Pattern Thin carve and satin nitro finish for a natural, addictive feel.

To further maximize the guitar’s inherent tone and clarity, the CE 24 features PRS 85/15 pickups, which were designed to have clarity across their extended high and low end frequencies. The electronics consist of a volume and push/pull tone control with 3-way toggle switch for a total of six classic sounds.

The PRS CE 24 now comes with PRS Phase III tuners, featuring a handsome open-back design, unplated brass shafts, and highly-usable gear ratio.

The original CE was introduced in 1988 and offered players PRS design and quality with the added snap and sparkle of traditional bolt-on guitars.

## Accolades

"Ultimately, the CE 24 begs for a test drive, especially by skeptics. This isn’t the first PRS that’s forged a bridge between differing solidbody designs, but it’s also its own animal – a serious professional instrument that can cover all the bases...a formidable piece of American guitar-making.”

- Vintage Guitar

"...there’s a character here that leans just a little towards a good Fender, a percussive edge or subtle flavor that is what attracted so many of us to those original CEs..."

- Guitarist

"If you're looking for something a little different but still want a high-quality US-built guitar with a lot of versatility, excellent ergonomics and playability and great looks too, but want it all at a reasonably realistic price that's low enough that you'll actually use the guitar instead of putting it into a glass case and just staring at it, check out the return of the Paul Reed Smith CE 24."

- Harmony Central

"Sonically, the CE 24 hit all of the marks...Exploring all the options would probably have taken me days (or weeks), and I doubt I’d find a tone that the CE 24 couldn’t emulate effectively.”

- Guitar Player

"If I were the type to limit myself to just one guitar (hint: I’m not), I could easily do an entire gig with just the CE24 running from classic rock, to indie rock, to alt-country, and on."

- Tone Report

“If you are on the hunt for endless tone options and value beautiful design, look no further; the CE 24 might just be your new favorite axe.”

- She Shreds

"The CE24 was a total game changer for me. Its sleek design allows me to reach every note and chord with ease, while the 85/15 pickups allow me to truly express the tone I'm after whether it's clean or crunchy."

- Dylan Bowman, I Prevail

The CE 24 Semi-Hollow boasts PRS 85/15 pickups, which were designed to have clarity across their extended high- and low-end frequencies. The electronics consist of a volume and push/pull tone control with a 3-way toggle switch, giving a total of six classic sounds from the PRS 85/15 pickups.

The PRS CE 24 Semi-Hollow now comes with PRS Phase III tuners, featuring a handsome open-back design, unplated brass shafts, and highly-usable gear ratio.

The original CE was introduced in 1988, offering players traditional PRS design and quality with the added snap and sparkle of a bolt-on guitar.

The PRS CE 22 Limited Edition also comes with PRS Phase III Locking Tuners, featuring a handsome open-back design, unplated brass shafts, and highly usable gear ratio.

# NF 53

“I am so pleased with the feedback from the artists who have played this guitar – everyone is telling us that we have something special here. If you are a fan of this style and tone, the NF 53 will take you where you want to go. To me, to have this kind of beautiful high end without the hum is game changing.” – Paul Reed Smith

The PRS NF 53 is a powerful guitar that combines classic tones with modern design. Inspired by one of Paul Reed Smith’s vintage guitars from 1953, the PRS NF 53 combines a swamp ash body and 22-fret, 25.5” scale length bolt-on maple neck with maple fretboard with a special set of PRS Narrowfield pickups. PRS Narrowfield DD (Deep Dish) pickups are made with taller bobbins to fit more winds and extra metal pieces in between the magnets for a more focused, powerful tone.

Paired with a volume and tone control and 3-way blade pickup switch, the NF 53 allows players to easily dial in their sound. The steel plate-style bridge, bone nut, and PRS Phase III tuners with unplated brass shafts all work together to provide precise and reliable tuning stability while promoting sustain and powerful tone.

Whether you are a seasoned player or just starting out, the PRS NF 53 is an addictive guitar you won’t want to put down.

## Accolades

“Having been a huge fan of PRS for many years, I was ecstatic to hear about the NF53 model. Once I got my hands on it, it quickly became my favorite guitar I have ever played. The playability, per PRS standards, is second to none and I’ve never encountered a more versatile instrument. It has everything I could ever need or want from an electric guitar. Twangy and beefy…smooth and crystal clear: the NF 53 is a total game changer! PRS have knocked it out of the park yet again!”

- Trey Hensley

“The NF 53 can scream, twang, or sing with subtlety. It’s responsive and touch sensitive—the notes are simply jumping out of this thing. On the stage and in the studio, getting single coil tones with zero hum thanks to the Narrowfield pickups is a game changer. The neck is the perfect amount of chunk. It can more than handle any gig and it’s just a blast to play.”

- Rick Lollar

“As a professional musician, I have played countless guitars over the years. From the moment I picked up the new NF53, I knew I was holding something special. The body pays tribute to the classic Telecaster design but with modern contours that make it more comfortable. The neck is smooth, comfortable, and the playability is exceptional. The pickups deliver a modern, punchy tone that's perfect for rock, blues or jazz, but it still retains that classic Tele twang. I can’t recommend the NF53 enough. It’s a top-quality instrument that's perfect for any serious musician.”

- Mike Seal

“Absolutely blown away! As a huge fan of T style guitars, this checks all the boxes. It can twang, it can rock - I’d take this on any gig that got thrown my way knowing I could cover tons of ground with it. As I’ve come to expect from every PRS - exceptional fit and finish and plays like a dream!”

- Seth Rosenbloom

“The new PRS NF 53 is as fun to play as it is to look at. A modern take on a classic. The feel of this guitar is as comfortable as I’ve come to expect from PRS and the tone is warm, woody and articulate. It has immediately found a home in my arsenal as a go to guitar and I have no reason to believe that will change anytime soon!”

- Kevin Arrowsmith, Luke Bryan

"What more need be said: the NF53 simply blew me away…and continues to every time I plug in! This is an exciting chapter in the PRS story and one you need to check out! Congratulations to Paul and staff - well done!

- Dan Weller, Tyler Hubbard

# NF 53

“I am so pleased with the feedback from the artists who have played this guitar – everyone is telling us that we have something special here. If you are a fan of this style and tone, the NF 53 will take you where you want to go. To me, to have this kind of beautiful high end without the hum is game changing.” – Paul Reed Smith

The PRS NF 53 is a powerful guitar that combines classic tones with modern design. Inspired by one of Paul Reed Smith’s vintage guitars from 1953, the PRS NF 53 combines a swamp ash body and 22-fret, 25.5” scale length bolt-on maple neck with maple fretboard with a special set of PRS Narrowfield pickups. PRS Narrowfield DD (Deep Dish) pickups are made with taller bobbins to fit more winds and extra metal pieces in between the magnets for a more focused, powerful tone.

Paired with a volume and tone control and 3-way blade pickup switch, the NF 53 allows players to easily dial in their sound. The steel plate-style bridge, bone nut, and PRS Phase III tuners with unplated brass shafts all work together to provide precise and reliable tuning stability while promoting sustain and powerful tone.

Whether you are a seasoned player or just starting out, the PRS NF 53 is an addictive guitar you won’t want to put down.

# Myles Kennedy

Introducing Myles Kennedy’s first signature model. Known for his work in Alter Bridge, Slash and the Conspirators, and his own solo recordings, Kennedy is an accomplished guitarist who brings blues and jazz style to rock guitar playing. This new signature model mirrors Kennedy’s rock sensibilities with a nod to historic designs. While the aesthetic may have players hearing chicken pickin’ in their heads – and this guitar can certainly reach twang territory – it is made to play like a rock machine.

“This guitar captures the spirit of my favorite older instruments. With that said, since we developed this guitar, most of my vintage instruments rarely see the light of day,” said Kennedy.

The PRS Myles Kennedy signature guitar features a swamp ash body, a 22-fret, 25.5” scale length maple neck with maple fretboard, and two PRS Narrowfield MK pickups. The PRS Narrowfield MK pickups were carefully voiced to capture the courage of humbuckers and the spank of single coils. PRS Narrowfields provided the perfect starting point for this design, with their ability to deliver thick single-coil sounds without the hum. These pickups are paired with a 5-way blade switch and a push/pull tone control that acts as a preset tone roll- off, bringing down the higher frequencies on the treble pickup so you can dig in to the fullest.

“I watched Myles throughout his career alternate between humbucking and single coil sounds without giving anything up on either side. These pickups took us months to dial in, and I think they capture that balance that Myles mastered beautifully,” said Paul Reed Smith.

Other features include a PRS plate-style steel bridge, vintage-style locking tuners, bone nut, and Kennedy’s “Geometric Owl” logo from his “Ides of March” solo release, representing wisdom and adaptability.

“I feel like we managed to touch on the elusive quality that makes you want to play with this guitar. It beckons you to take it off the wall or out of the case and make music.” – Myles Kennedy

# Swamp Ash Special

# Fresh Face and a Versatile Voice

The PRS Swamp Ash Special brings a unique look and sound to the PRS Bolt-On line up. Its swamp ash body is equipped with a versatile hum/“single”/hum pickup configuration. Two 58/15 LT pickups flank a PRS Narrowfield in the middle position, which adds a single-coil bite – without the hum. Paired with a volume, tone, 5-way blade switch, and dual mini-toggle coil-tap switches (for the first time on this model), the Swamp Ash Special has a total of twelve sound combinations. Roll back the tone control for added growl, turn it up for some shimmer, and have fun exploring this versatile tonal palette.

The volume level between the humbucking and single-coil settings will remain even through it all. Additional specifications for the Swamp Ash Special include a 22-fret 25” scale length maple neck, rosewood fretboard, Phase III locking tuners with unplated brass shafts, and the PRS Patented tremolo.

Overall, the PRS Swamp Ash Special offers tight low-end, bright but mellow high-end, and a welcome twangy tone that can reach “hot country,” blues, and jazz territory. It is a versatile guitar to add to any arsenal.

This model is also available with a maple fretboard. To explore that offering, please click here.

# Swamp Ash Special

# Fresh Face and a Versatile Voice

The PRS Swamp Ash Special brings a unique look and sound to the PRS Bolt-On line up. Its swamp ash body is equipped with a versatile hum/“single”/hum pickup configuration. Two 58/15 LT pickups flank a PRS Narrowfield in the middle position, which adds a single-coil bite – without the hum. Paired with a volume, tone, 5-way blade switch, and dual mini-toggle coil-tap switches (for the first time on this model), the Swamp Ash Special has a total of twelve sound combinations. Roll back the tone control for added growl, turn it up for some shimmer, and have fun exploring this versatile tonal palette.

The volume level between the humbucking and single-coil settings will remain even through it all. Additional specifications for the Swamp Ash Special include a 22-fret 25” scale length maple neck, rosewood fretboard, Phase III locking tuners with unplated brass shafts, and the PRS Patented tremolo.

Overall, the PRS Swamp Ash Special offers tight low-end, bright but mellow high-end, and a welcome twangy tone that can reach “hot country,” blues, and jazz territory. It is a versatile guitar to add to any arsenal.

This model is also available with a maple fretboard. To explore that offering, please click here.

# Silver Sky Maple

# Reach For The Sky

“It’s been a dream of mine for years to design a guitar that includes some of my favorite vintage specifications but with a modern spirit and aesthetic. After two years of study and refinement, the Silver Sky is my vision of what a reboot of the electric guitar should look and feel like.” – John Mayer

The PRS Silver Sky is an idealized version of a vintage single-coil guitar where every detail adds up and sets this guitar apart from the pack and the past. The result of a close collaboration between Grammy Award-winning musician John Mayer and Paul Reed Smith, the Silver Sky is based off of years of development. Incorporating Mayer and Smith’s favorite elements of 1963 and 1964 instruments with an eye toward modern references, the PRS Silver Sky delivers the warmth and familiarity of an old guitar with the finesse of a brand-new instrument.

Some of the more distinctive specifications include, the headstock shape, tuners, bridge, pickups, and neck and fretboard options. The headstock shape is based on PRS’s trademark design, but inverted both to accommodate Mayer’s playing style and also to keep a consistent length of string behind the nut, which makes staying in tune easier. The tuners are a traditional vintage-style, closed-back tuner, but with PRS’s locking design. The steel tremolo takes the patented PRS design and incorporates Gen III knife-edge screws. Setup flush to the body in the neutral position so that the tremolo bridge only goes down in pitch, the bridge’s increased contact with the body allows the guitar itself to be acoustically louder, which in turn improves the signal to noise ratio of the single-coil pickups. The 635JM single-coil pickups are very round and full, with a musical high end that is never “ice-picky” or brash.

The Silver Sky comes with the option of a rosewood or maple fretboard. The maple fretboard option comes with the original 635JM neck shape, while the rosewood fretboard option has been subtly modified in the shoulders to feel more “rounded” in your hand. Both neck shapes were designed by researching vintage instruments and Mayer test-driving guitars on stage to find what felt right. The fretboard radius on both options is 7.25”.

Other high-quality specifications include a bone nut, a molded metal jack plate (curved to make plugging and unplugging a guitar cable hassle-free), retooled knobs, and PRS’s double action truss rod (accessible from the front of the headstock for ease of use). PRS premium gig bag included.

This model is also available with a rosewood fretboard. To explore that offering, please click here.

## Accolades

- Premier Guitar

“[The PRS Silver Sky] offers up shockingly good vintage tones and feel, but modern production methods and PRS’s legendary attention to detail have eliminated all the problems that go along with vintage instruments…including the monstrous price tag!”

- Guitar Interactive

“Tonally, it’s big, clear, and airy when played clean, and fat and resonant with overdrive kicked on…There’s so much to dig with this guitar, but most are sure to keep going back to that heel and amazing upper-fret reach, which changes everything.”

- Vintage Guitar

“After playing the Silver Sky, it’s easy to understand why it took so long to design and why John Mayer embraced this endeavor. For aficionados of the classic three single-coil pickup solidbody guitar design, this is truly one of the finest examples ever produced.”

- Guitar World

- Guitar Player

“This is not simply a Strat with a PRS headstock. As Paul Reed Smith pointed out in an interview, every aspect of the guitar was thoughtfully designed, or redesigned. But don’t just take our word for it. Try one out. You may be just as impressed as we are.”

# Silver Sky Maple

# Reach For The Sky

“It’s been a dream of mine for years to design a guitar that includes some of my favorite vintage specifications but with a modern spirit and aesthetic. After two years of study and refinement, the Silver Sky is my vision of what a reboot of the electric guitar should look and feel like.” – John Mayer

The PRS Silver Sky is an idealized version of a vintage single-coil guitar where every detail adds up and sets this guitar apart from the pack and the past. The result of a close collaboration between Grammy Award-winning musician John Mayer and Paul Reed Smith, the Silver Sky is based off of years of development. Incorporating Mayer and Smith’s favorite elements of 1963 and 1964 instruments with an eye toward modern references, the PRS Silver Sky delivers the warmth and familiarity of an old guitar with the finesse of a brand-new instrument.

Some of the more distinctive specifications include, the headstock shape, tuners, bridge, pickups, and neck and fretboard options. The headstock shape is based on PRS’s trademark design, but inverted both to accommodate Mayer’s playing style and also to keep a consistent length of string behind the nut, which makes staying in tune easier. The tuners are a traditional vintage-style, closed-back tuner, but with PRS’s locking design. The steel tremolo takes the patented PRS design and incorporates Gen III knife-edge screws. Setup flush to the body in the neutral position so that the tremolo bridge only goes down in pitch, the bridge’s increased contact with the body allows the guitar itself to be acoustically louder, which in turn improves the signal to noise ratio of the single-coil pickups. The 635JM single-coil pickups are very round and full, with a musical high end that is never “ice-picky” or brash.

The Silver Sky comes with the option of a rosewood or maple fretboard. The maple fretboard option comes with the original 635JM neck shape, while the rosewood fretboard option has been subtly modified in the shoulders to feel more “rounded” in your hand. Both neck shapes were designed by researching vintage instruments and Mayer test-driving guitars on stage to find what felt right. The fretboard radius on both options is 7.25”.

Other high-quality specifications include a bone nut, a molded metal jack plate (curved to make plugging and unplugging a guitar cable hassle-free), retooled knobs, and PRS’s double action truss rod (accessible from the front of the headstock for ease of use). PRS premium gig bag included.

This model is also available with a rosewood fretboard. To explore that offering, please click here.

## Accolades

- Premier Guitar

“[The PRS Silver Sky] offers up shockingly good vintage tones and feel, but modern production methods and PRS’s legendary attention to detail have eliminated all the problems that go along with vintage instruments…including the monstrous price tag!”

- Guitar Interactive

“Tonally, it’s big, clear, and airy when played clean, and fat and resonant with overdrive kicked on…There’s so much to dig with this guitar, but most are sure to keep going back to that heel and amazing upper-fret reach, which changes everything.”

- Vintage Guitar

“After playing the Silver Sky, it’s easy to understand why it took so long to design and why John Mayer embraced this endeavor. For aficionados of the classic three single-coil pickup solidbody guitar design, this is truly one of the finest examples ever produced.”

- Guitar World

“A superb vintage and experience-informed three single-coil bolt-on. Build playability, sound and typical PRS attention to detail and quality.”

- Music Radar

"Bottom line: The Silver Sky absolutely delivers on the promise of being a damn-near-perfect version of this type of guitar…Paul Reed Smith doesn’t mess around, and you’ve got to assume that he never would have made this guitar if he didn’t think he could bring something inspiring to the party.”

- Guitar Player

“This is not simply a Strat with a PRS headstock. As Paul Reed Smith pointed out in an interview, every aspect of the guitar was thoughtfully designed, or redesigned. But don’t just take our word for it. Try one out. You may be just as impressed as we are.”

- MusicPlayers.com

"This guitar isn't designed to be just a collector's item that is hung on a wall to look at, it was built to be played and pushed to the limit."

- Maverick Magazine

“You can take as many modern or vintage twists as you want on an instrument. The real question is: does it work on stage or in the studio? Silver Sky works.”

- Clay Cook, Zac Brown Band

“Man I am hooked on this Silver Sky. Can’t stop playing it! The feel and dynamics are really next level.”

- Eric Krasno

“The Silver Sky is the closest anyone has ever come to bettering Leo's original blueprint for the Stratocaster.”

# Fiore

# Play in Full Bloom

“All guitarists have a sound in their head – a sound that evolves and grows as they progress, discovering all of the beautiful idiosyncrasies that define their individual voice. To facilitate this process, players need a vibrant, dynamic guitar that becomes a free space in which their personality can unfold. PRS and I designed Fiore (Italian for ‘flower’) to be this guitar.” – Mark Lettieri

The PRS Fiore model continues PRS Guitars’ journey into the bolt-on, single-coil guitar world. Developed with guitarist, composer, producer, and instructor Mark Lettieri, the PRS Fiore offers a modern aesthetic, effortless playability, and an addictive and sophisticated tonal canvas.

The PRS Fiore pickups were carefully voiced by Lettieri and PRS to allow players a platform to explore and find their voice. The Fiore-S single coil offers exceptional malleability in tone. Capable of capturing all the articulation found in everything from whisper-quiet melodies to full on funk and rock explosivity, this pickup reacts to each player's unique approach.

The Fiore-H humbucker fulfills Lettieri’s desire for extensive versatility in the treble position: enough power and punch for high-gain lead tones, but with a smooth top end that allows the pickup to be played clean, even with the volume knob wide open. Both the Fiore-S and -H pickups work seamlessly together, producing balance, clarity, and that elusive ‘bloom’ in all five positions.

But the tone exploration doesn’t stop there. The Fiore model features a 5-way blade switch with traditional wiring (bridge / bridge + middle / middle / middle + neck / neck). The Fiore also features a single volume and two push/pull tone controls, which further adds to this guitar’s tone-shaping abilities.

Lettieri brought several personal design choices to this model, including a custom truss rod cover drawn by his very own mom. Other appointments include a Swamp Ash body, 22 fret maple neck with maple fretboard, and 25.5” scale length for classic look and feel.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS 2-Point Steel Tremolo

Comfortable tremolo functionality with exceptional tuning stability, featuring a classic 2-point mounting system.

### Vintage-Style, Locking Tuners

Traditional vintage style, closed back tuners outfitted with PRS’s locking system.

### PRS Fiore-H and -S

Single/Single/Hum design delivering balance and clarity that blooms in all five positions.

# Fiore Satin

# Play in Full Bloom

“All guitarists have a sound in their head – a sound that evolves and grows as they progress, discovering all of the beautiful idiosyncrasies that define their individual voice. To facilitate this process, players need a vibrant, dynamic guitar that becomes a free space in which their personality can unfold. PRS and I designed Fiore (Italian for ‘flower’) to be this guitar.” – Mark Lettieri

The PRS Fiore model continues PRS Guitars’ journey into the bolt-on, single-coil guitar world. Developed with guitarist, composer, producer, and instructor Mark Lettieri, the PRS Fiore offers a modern aesthetic, effortless playability, and an addictive and sophisticated tonal canvas.

The PRS Fiore pickups were carefully voiced by Lettieri and PRS to allow players a platform to explore and find their voice. The Fiore-S single coil offers exceptional malleability in tone. Capable of capturing all the articulation found in everything from whisper-quiet melodies to full on funk and rock explosivity, this pickup reacts to each player's unique approach.

The Fiore-H humbucker fulfills Lettieri’s desire for extensive versatility in the treble position: enough power and punch for high-gain lead tones, but with a smooth top end that allows the pickup to be played clean, even with the volume knob wide open. Both the Fiore-S and -H pickups work seamlessly together, producing balance, clarity, and that elusive ‘bloom’ in all five positions.

But the tone exploration doesn’t stop there. The Fiore model features a 5-way blade switch with traditional wiring (bridge / bridge + middle / middle / middle + neck / neck). The Fiore also features a single volume and two push/pull tone controls, which further adds to this guitar’s tone-shaping abilities.

Lettieri brought several personal design choices to this model, including a custom truss rod cover drawn by his very own mom. Other appointments include a Swamp Ash body, 22 fret maple neck with maple fretboard, and 25.5” scale length for classic look and feel.

# Fiore HH

# Double Hum Power

“For players who love the specifications and versatility of the original Fiore but whose sound revolves more around humbuckers, this is the guitar for you.” — Mark Lettieri

Developed with guitarist, composer, producer, and instructor Mark Lettieri, the PRS Fiore HH offers another tonal platform for players searching for vibrancy, dynamics, balance, and clarity. With a swamp ash body, 25.5” scale length maple neck, 22-fret rosewood fretboard, and 2-point steel tremolo, the PRS Fiore HH keeps the original Fiore’s modern aesthetic and effortless playability. Where the Fiore HH diverges from the original model is with its dual humbucker setup.

The Fiore-H humbuckers have enough power and punch for high-gain lead tones but with a smooth top end that allows the pickup to be played clean, even with the volume knob wide open. By pairing these pickups with a master volume, two push/pull tone knobs, and 3-way blade switch, the Fiore HH brings exciting voicing options to players. Each tone control acts as an individual series/parallel selector for each pickup. When in series, you get the full humbucker sound - warm full lows and mids and an articulate top end. When in parallel, the pickups take on more of a single coil sparkle with a slightly scooped feel and more brilliance. In all, players can explore eight tonal combinations.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS 2-Point Steel Tremolo

Comfortable tremolo functionality with exceptional tuning stability, featuring a classic 2-point mounting system.

### Vintage-Style Locking Tuners

Traditional vintage style, closed back tuners outfitted with PRS’s locking system.

### Hum/Hum Pickups

Full humbucker sound: warm full lows and mids, and an articulate top end. Pull up on the tone knob to put the pickups in parallel and they take on more single coil sparkle with a slightly scooped feel and more brilliance.

# Fiore HH

# Double Hum Power

“For players who love the specifications and versatility of the original Fiore but whose sound revolves more around humbuckers, this is the guitar for you.” — Mark Lettieri

Developed with guitarist, composer, producer, and instructor Mark Lettieri, the PRS Fiore HH offers another tonal platform for players searching for vibrancy, dynamics, balance, and clarity. With a swamp ash body, 25.5” scale length maple neck, 22-fret rosewood fretboard, and 2-point steel tremolo, the PRS Fiore HH keeps the original Fiore’s modern aesthetic and effortless playability. Where the Fiore HH diverges from the original model is with its dual humbucker setup.

The Fiore-H humbuckers have enough power and punch for high-gain lead tones but with a smooth top end that allows the pickup to be played clean, even with the volume knob wide open. By pairing these pickups with a master volume, two push/pull tone knobs, and 3-way blade switch, the Fiore HH brings exciting voicing options to players. Each tone control acts as an individual series/parallel selector for each pickup. When in series, you get the full humbucker sound - warm full lows and mids and an articulate top end. When in parallel, the pickups take on more of a single coil sparkle with a slightly scooped feel and more brilliance. In all, players can explore eight tonal combinations.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS 2-Point Steel Tremolo

Comfortable tremolo functionality with exceptional tuning stability, featuring a classic 2-point mounting system.

### Vintage-Style Locking Tuners

Traditional vintage style, closed back tuners outfitted with PRS’s locking system.

### Hum/Hum Pickups

Full humbucker sound: warm full lows and mids, and an articulate top end. Pull up on the tone knob to put the pickups in parallel and they take on more single coil sparkle with a slightly scooped feel and more brilliance.

# S2 Custom 24

# A Classic Reimagined

The Custom 24 is the original PRS. Since its introduction, it has offered a unique option for serious players and defined PRS tone and playability. The S2 Custom 24 takes the original PRS guitar, the Custom 24, and re-imagines it with stripped-down features and a new aesthetic.

Retaining the classic maple top/mahogany back combination with our classic body shape and an asymmetrical beveled top, this guitar has a resonant, powerful voice. Its versatility comes from its Maryland, USA-wound PRS 85/15 pickups and 5-way blade switch, offering all the same sounds as the flagship Custom 24. The PRS S2 Custom 24 now comes with PRS Phase III tuners, featuring a handsome open-back design, unplated brass shafts, and highly-usable gear ratio. Familiar for PRS players of old, and a fresh take for players of all types.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo

Patented design, delivering tonal fidelity, player comfort, and tuning stability.

### PRS Phase III Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

Modern locking technology with vintage elegance, these lightweight tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS 85/15 Pickups

Uncovered pickups with remarkable clarity and extended high and low end, perfect for more modern applications.

## Accolades

"From the second I plugged in the PRS Custom 24, I felt as if I've never had so much power being a guitarist. Its original unique sound is unmatched by any other guitar on the market!!! It has the most full tone of any guitar ever, and that's just stock. I now consider it as an extension of my body... Hell, I even sleep with the thing... (TRUTH)”

- Bryce Klemer, Pacific Dub

"When you're on the road every day, it takes a toll on your gear. These guitars are by far the best I have used PERIOD! Day in day out my S2 Custom 24 performs as it should. I beat this thing to death, literally, and it still stays in tune and sounds amazing!”

- David Whitaker, Another Lost Year

"Personally, with our style of music and our live show, the weight and feel of my S2 Custom 24 is the perfect guitar for me. Absolutely the best guitar I've ever owned, amazing tone, and takes a beating, you'll have to pry it out of my hands, and I hold on for life.”

- Clinton Cunanan, Another Lost Year

"My S2 is my work horse, both live and in the studio. It's got the tonal versatility which sets PRS apart, and the quality of workmanship which means it effortlessly withstands the sweat and the knocks of our live show. I wouldn't be without it anywhere.”

- Simon Delaney, Don Broco

# S2 Custom 24

# A Classic Reimagined

The Custom 24 is the original PRS. Since its introduction, it has offered a unique option for serious players and defined PRS tone and playability. The S2 Custom 24 takes the original PRS guitar, the Custom 24, and re-imagines it with stripped-down features and a new aesthetic.

Retaining the classic maple top/mahogany back combination with our classic body shape and an asymmetrical beveled top, this guitar has a resonant, powerful voice. Its versatility comes from its Maryland, USA-wound PRS 85/15 pickups and 5-way blade switch, offering all the same sounds as the flagship Custom 24. The PRS S2 Custom 24 now comes with PRS Phase III tuners, featuring a handsome open-back design, unplated brass shafts, and highly-usable gear ratio. Familiar for PRS players of old, and a fresh take for players of all types.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo

Patented design, delivering tonal fidelity, player comfort, and tuning stability.

### PRS Phase III Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

Modern locking technology with vintage elegance, these lightweight tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS 85/15 Pickups

Uncovered pickups with remarkable clarity and extended high and low end, perfect for more modern applications.

# S2 Custom 24-08

# Gig-Ready Versatility

The S2 Custom 24-08 shares many of the same specifications as the S2 Custom 24 but adds a new level of versatility with its intuitive switching system. Platform specifications for this guitar include a maple top, mahogany back and neck, and rosewood fretboard with bird inlays. It boasts 24 frets, a 25” scale length Pattern Thin neck, PRS’s Patented Gen III Tremolo, and Phase III Tuners with unplated brass shafts and wing buttons.

The Maryland, USA-made PRS TCI pickups deliver full, single-coil tones reminiscent of vintage soapbars. The pickups are paired with a 3-way toggle switch and two mini-toggle EQ switches. The dual EQ mini-toggle switches act as tuned high-pass filters when engaged (in the up position), removing shelved low-end and allowing the high frequencies through for more clarity and musical highs.

For classic PRS feel with expanded flexibility, check out the PRS S2 Custom 24-08.

# S2 McCarty 594

# Vintage Inspiration with Rock-Solid Design

The S2 McCarty 594 is a versatile, vintage-inspired instrument that delivers both humbucking and single-coil tones in a modern, reliable package. Featuring a bound 22-fret Pattern Vintage neck and slightly thicker back for more sustain, the S2 McCarty 594 feels and sounds like a guitar you’ve been playing forever. A zinc two-piece bridge with brass saddles and steel studs, bone nut, and PRS Phase III tuners with unplated brass shafts anchor this guitar and stay true to the promise of the McCarty family.

Loaded with Maryland, USA-made PRS 58/15 LT pickups, the S2 McCarty 594 has a warm, vintage-inspired tone. Whether you are looking for authentic humbucking tones or nuanced, sweet single-coil sounds, the S2 McCarty 594 can seamlessly master both sonic territories thanks to both the pickups and dual volume and push/pull tone control layout.

Designed to capture the heart of the McCarty family of instruments and stay true to the S2 Series spirit, the S2 McCarty 594 is a guitar your arsenal deserves.

The zinc two-piece bridge with brass saddles and steel studs, bone nut, and Phase III tuners with unplated brass shafts anchor this guitar and stay true to the promise of the McCarty family.

Designed to capture the heart of the McCarty family of instruments and stay true to the S2 Series spirit, the S2 McCarty 594 Thinline stands on its own as a gig-ready, roadworthy workhorse for the player who wants to cover a lot of musical ground.

# S2 Standard 22

# All-Mahogany Workhorse

The PRS S2 Standard 22 is an all-mahogany workhorse guitar for gigging musicians. With vintage sweetness, warmth, and full tone, the S2 Standard 22 excels both plugged straight into an amp and with a modern pedalboard.

The S2 Standard 22’s solid mahogany body and set neck give this guitar a distinctive resonance and powerful sustain, and when mahogany’s rich, round tone meets the Maryland, USA-made PRS 58/15 LT pickups, there are plenty of clear highs and strong mids to be dialed in. Accentuate your playing without going out of tune with the PRS patented tremolo, and explore an array of tones with the 5-way blade pickup switch.

For the first-time player or the serious musician who wants to cover a lot of ground with their music, the S2 Standard 22 is a perfect choice.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo

Patented design, delivering tonal fidelity, player comfort, and tuning stability.

### PRS Phase III Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

Modern locking technology with vintage elegance, these lightweight tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS 58/15 LT Pickups

“Low turn” pickups with vintage warm, clear tone.

## Accolades

"The question in every cynical mind is 'so, where have the corners been cut?' And the answer is 'they haven't. They're just cleverly made'.”

- Interactive Guitar Magazine

"Flexible all-round guitar for advanced and professionals who put their focus on less pompous appearance, but more to a rich tone and want spending less money properly.” (review link - review in German)

- Delamar

# S2 Standard 22

# All-Mahogany Workhorse

The PRS S2 Standard 22 is an all-mahogany workhorse guitar for gigging musicians. With vintage sweetness, warmth, and full tone, the S2 Standard 22 excels both plugged straight into an amp and with a modern pedalboard.

The S2 Standard 22’s solid mahogany body and set neck give this guitar a distinctive resonance and powerful sustain, and when mahogany’s rich, round tone meets the Maryland, USA-made PRS 58/15 LT pickups, there are plenty of clear highs and strong mids to be dialed in. Accentuate your playing without going out of tune with the PRS patented tremolo, and explore an array of tones with the 5-way blade pickup switch.

For the first-time player or the serious musician who wants to cover a lot of ground with their music, the S2 Standard 22 is a perfect choice.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo

Patented design, delivering tonal fidelity, player comfort, and tuning stability.

### PRS Phase III Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

Modern locking technology with vintage elegance, these lightweight tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS 58/15 LT Pickups

“Low turn” pickups with vintage warm, clear tone.

## Accolades

"The question in every cynical mind is 'so, where have the corners been cut?' And the answer is 'they haven't. They're just cleverly made'.”

- Interactive Guitar Magazine

"Flexible all-round guitar for advanced and professionals who put their focus on less pompous appearance, but more to a rich tone and want spending less money properly.” (review link - review in German)

- Delamar

# S2 Standard 24

# Bold. Classic. Gig Ready.

With its solid build and versatile electronics platform, the S2 Standard 24 is a true player’s guitar that handles as well as it sounds whether plugged straight into your amp or run through your pedal board. The subtle aesthetic of mahogany and vintage vibe of pickguard-mounted electronics give the S2 Standard 24 an understated look for players who prefer a stripped-down approach to their music.

The S2 Standard 24’s solid mahogany body and set neck give this guitar a distinctive resonance and powerful sustain, and when mahogany’s rich, round, warm tone meets the Maryland, USA-made PRS 58/15 LT pickups, there are plenty of clear highs and strong mids to be dialed in. The original PRS Standard, introduced in 1987, evolved from Paul Smith’s pre-factory all-mahogany guitars. Reimagined here for the S2 Series, the Standard 24 is gig-ready with a price tag to match.

# S2 Standard 22 Satin

# Bare-Bones Workhorse

The PRS S2 Standard 22 Satin is a workhorse guitar for gigging musicians. With an all-mahogany body and 22-fret set mahogany neck, this guitar is warm and sweet, making it toneful enough to stand up plugged straight into an amplifier and solid enough to serve as a great platform for even the most modern pedal board set up. The S2 Standard 22’s thin satin nitro finish gives this instrument a wonderful resonance and an open clarity, and when mahogany’s rich, round, warm tone meets the Maryland, USA-made PRS 58/15 LT pickups, there are plenty of clear highs and strong mids to be dialed in.

The PRS S2 Standard 22 Satin is outfitted with the PRS patented tremolo and PRS Phase III tuners, featuring a handsome open-back design, unplated brass shafts, and highly-usable gear ratio. For the player who wants to cover a lot of ground with their music, the S2 Standard 22 Satin is a perfect choice.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo

Patented design, delivering tonal fidelity, player comfort, and tuning stability.

### PRS Phase III Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

Modern locking technology with vintage elegance, these lightweight tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS 58/15 LT Pickups

“Low turn” pickups with vintage warm, clear tone.

# S2 Standard 22 Satin

# Bare-Bones Workhorse

The PRS S2 Standard 22 Satin is a workhorse guitar for gigging musicians. With an all-mahogany body and 22-fret set mahogany neck, this guitar is warm and sweet, making it toneful enough to stand up plugged straight into an amplifier and solid enough to serve as a great platform for even the most modern pedal board set up. The S2 Standard 22’s thin satin nitro finish gives this instrument a wonderful resonance and an open clarity, and when mahogany’s rich, round, warm tone meets the Maryland, USA-made PRS 58/15 LT pickups, there are plenty of clear highs and strong mids to be dialed in.

The PRS S2 Standard 22 Satin is outfitted with the PRS patented tremolo and PRS Phase III tuners, featuring a handsome open-back design, unplated brass shafts, and highly-usable gear ratio. For the player who wants to cover a lot of ground with their music, the S2 Standard 22 Satin is a perfect choice.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo

Patented design, delivering tonal fidelity, player comfort, and tuning stability.

### PRS Phase III Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

Modern locking technology with vintage elegance, these lightweight tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS 58/15 LT Pickups

“Low turn” pickups with vintage warm, clear tone.

# S2 Standard 24 Satin

# A Classic Refinished

With its solid build and versatile, vintage electronics platform, the S2 Standard 24 Satin is a true player’s guitar. The thin satin nitro finish gives this instrument a wonderful resonance and an open clarity that’s noticeable even unplugged. The subtle aesthetic of mahogany and vintage vibe of pickguard-mounted electronics give the S2 Standard 24 an understated look for players who prefer a stripped-down approach to their music.

The solid mahogany body and set neck provide a distinctive resonance and powerful sustain, and when mahogany’s rich, round, warm tone meets the Maryland, USA-made PRS 58/15 LT pickups, there are plenty of clear highs and strong mids to be dialed in. Anchored by the PRS patented tremolo and PRS Phase III locking tuners with unplated brass shafts, the PRS S2 Standard 24 Satin is built for power and reliability night after night.

# S2 Vela

# Offset Design with Unforgettable Tone

Anchored by PRS playability and craftsmanship, the S2 Vela is perfect for players who want PRS build quality and reliability with a fresh aesthetic. The Vela represents the maiden voyage into an offset body shape for PRS and is both elegant and distinctive.

Loaded with a PRS DS-01 humbucker in the treble pickup position and the PRS Narrowfield in the bass pickup position, the Vela has a bright, punchy tone that sounds great plugged into your pedalboard or straight into an amp. A coil-tap on the tone control allows the DS-01 pickup to split into single coils and explore a whole new range of tones.

The PRS plate-style bridge features two brass saddles specifically designed for great sustain and perfect intonation so both rhythm and lead tones sound great no matter where you are on the fretboard. In the studio or on the stage, you won’t want to leave this guitar at home.

## Additional Videos

These videos were created by our partners and friends. While many are not sponsored, some may feature paid partnerships. They all offer independent insights and reviews of our products.

## Featured Specifications

### Plate-Style Bridge

Our steel plate-style bridge is easy to string, comfortable, fully-intonating and it sounds great.

### PRS Phase III Non-Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

With vintage elegance, these lightweight tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

## Accolades

"If you’ve previously balked at trying a PRS because you’d didn’t dig the styling, this beautiful machine—and its beautiful tones—might flip that notion on its head.”

- Premier Guitar

"If the Vela had been made in the 1950's, it would be considered as classic as the Stratocaster. It's a natural guitar with a wonderful personality!”

- Walker Teret, Lower Dens

“PRS guitars are made with love and you can feel it when you play them. They are also made with an incredible understanding of what makes a guitar great. The Vela is a great rock guitar. It can do scuzz, fuzz, psych, punk, whatever you want and it also can scream some insane leads. I can’t get enough of this axe!”

- Michael Gibbons, Bardo Pond

“The Vela nails all of the vintage tones I've become accustomed to using in the studio, and has become my go to live because of its stable intonation, tuning, and playability.”

- Thomas Onebane, Royal Teeth

“I think the PRS team has hit a home run with the Vela. In terms of quality and tone at this price point, I don’t think anyone else is making anything remotely close.”

- Jordan Smith, Diarrhea Planet

“Overall, the PRS S2 Vela is a great guitar at a great price point. This is the perfect jack-of-all-trades guitar and is one that will presumably last for many years to come.”

- Crafted

"PRS have really created something important with the S2 range. Every guitar I’ve played has shown the thought, care and (yes) love that the company has thrown at the project. But the Vela may be the best yet. It is beautifully made, has a huge tonal range and sounds and feels lovely.”

- Guitar In Your Pocket

“This is SWEET. The feel and sound transcend what a guitar can be. The Vela has soul, it’s alive and part of something greater than you can imagine. It sounds so nice and is so beautiful. The Paul Reed Smith Vela, It’s a dream.”

- John Gibbons, Bardo Pond

“I've always been a bridge pickup guy and a sucker for big, bright, punchy guitar tones. I knew this guitar would be great for clean studio playing, but I was really pleasantly surprised by how well the Starla pickup worked for driving power-pop and punky, angular playing -- The tone is bright and punchy, but never too thin. The coil tap control is a neat function too, opening up an equally great tone with a little more chime to it. I can tell I'll be using this guitar for years to come in a variety of different projects.”

- Tommy Siegel, Jukebox The Ghost

A really broad range of sounds can be had from this guitar using the tone control, the three-way toggle selector and the coil split, especially if one were to run it through a larger amp with some tonal options and a pedal or two.”

- American Songwriter

“While it’s probably shocking to the PRS purists, I’m a sucker for offset guitars and the Vela design won me over instantly.”

- Tone Report

“With its versatile variety of tones, first-class craftsmanship and construction, and incredibly comfortable playability, the PRS S2 Vela is a new classic that will be embraced by discriminating players looking for something a little different.”

# S2 Vela

# Offset Design with Unforgettable Tone

Anchored by PRS playability and craftsmanship, the S2 Vela is perfect for players who want PRS build quality and reliability with a fresh aesthetic. The Vela represents the maiden voyage into an offset body shape for PRS and is both elegant and distinctive.

Loaded with a PRS DS-01 humbucker in the treble pickup position and the PRS Narrowfield in the bass pickup position, the Vela has a bright, punchy tone that sounds great plugged into your pedalboard or straight into an amp. A coil-tap on the tone control allows the DS-01 pickup to split into single coils and explore a whole new range of tones.

The PRS plate-style bridge features two brass saddles specifically designed for great sustain and perfect intonation so both rhythm and lead tones sound great no matter where you are on the fretboard. In the studio or on the stage, you won’t want to leave this guitar at home.

## Additional Videos

## Featured Specifications

### Plate-Style Bridge

Our steel plate-style bridge is easy to string, comfortable, fully-intonating and it sounds great.

### PRS Phase III Non-Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

# S2 Vela Semi-Hollow

# Offset Semi-Hollow, Full of Character

The S2 Vela Semi-Hollow is a vintage-inspired guitar with loads of personality and tonal textures. Its offset body shape is at once elegant and distinctive, and the all-mahogany design delivers warm, organic tone. The addition of semi-hollow construction and f-hole gives the Vela added resonance.

The pickguard-loaded electronics feature a PRS DS-01 pickup in the treble pickup position, providing a bright, chimey tone, and the PRS Narrowfield in the bass pickup position gives the Vela some noteworthy bite. The coil-tap on the tone control allows the treble pickup to split to single coils, providing even more tonal versatility.

Anchoring this guitar is the PRS plate-style bridge with two saddles that were designed to compensate for intonation. This bridge harkens back to Paul’s early designs and traditional bass plate-style bridges, but is top-loading for easy restringing. Like the bridge found on Paul’s Guitar and some Private Stock models, PRS’s plate-style bridge features brass saddles and a steel plate for maximum tonal sustain.

## Additional Videos

# S2 Vela Semi-Hollow Satin

# Offset Semi-Hollow That’s Full of Character

The S2 Vela Semi-Hollow Satin is a vintage-inspired, offset guitar with loads of personality and tonal textures. The all-mahogany body brings warmth and an organic tone, while the semi-hollow construction and thin, satin nitro finish give the Vela resonance and bloom.

The pickguard-loaded electronics feature a PRS DS-01 pickup in the treble pickup position, providing a bright, punky tone, while the PRS Narrowfield in the bass pickup position gives the Vela some noteworthy bite. The coil-tap on the tone control allows the treble pickup to split to single coils, providing even more tonal versatility.

Anchoring this guitar is the PRS plate-style bridge with two saddles that were designed to compensate for intonation. This bridge harkens back to Paul’s early designs and traditional bass plate-style bridges but is top-loading for easy restringing.

# S2 Vela Semi-Hollow Satin

# Offset Semi-Hollow That’s Full of Character

The S2 Vela Semi-Hollow Satin is a vintage-inspired, offset guitar with loads of personality and tonal textures. The all-mahogany body brings warmth and an organic tone, while the semi-hollow construction and thin, satin nitro finish give the Vela resonance and bloom.

The pickguard-loaded electronics feature a PRS DS-01 pickup in the treble pickup position, providing a bright, punky tone, while the PRS Narrowfield in the bass pickup position gives the Vela some noteworthy bite. The coil-tap on the tone control allows the treble pickup to split to single coils, providing even more tonal versatility.

Anchoring this guitar is the PRS plate-style bridge with two saddles that were designed to compensate for intonation. This bridge harkens back to Paul’s early designs and traditional bass plate-style bridges but is top-loading for easy restringing. Like the bridge found on Paul’s Guitar and some Private Stock models, PRS’s plate-style bridge features brass saddles and a steel plate for maximum tonal sustain.

## Featured Specifications

### Plate-Style Bridge

Our steel plate-style bridge is easy to string, comfortable, fully-intonating and it sounds great.

### PRS Phase III Non-Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

With vintage elegance, these lightweight tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS DS-01 & Narrowfield

A lively pickup combination that provides full midrange and articulate, chimey high-end.

# S2 Mira 594 Satin

# Built for the Stage

A true rock and roll guitar, the PRS S2 Mira 594 Satin is a great addition to any musician’s arsenal. The PRS S2 Mira 594 Satin features a bound 22-fret Pattern Thin neck with a 24.594” scale length. Its “sinky” satin nitro finish makes for an instantly comfortable neck and brings a naturally cool, stripped-down look. The PRS stoptail bridge with brass inserts and PRS Phase III tuners with brass shafts anchor this guitar, promoting resonance and open tone while ensuring tuning stability.

Pairing the Mira’s all-mahogany construction with PRS 58/15 LT vintage-voiced pickups means warm, focused midrange. The humbuckers are paired with two mini-toggle switches to individually tap the pickups, delivering both authentic humbucking and sweet, chimey single-coil sounds.

An all-mahogany workhorse, the PRS S2 Mira 594 Satin covers a wide range of styles with ease, including rock, blues, garage, and punk.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Stoptail with Brass Inserts

Engineered with curved string slots with brass inserts and brass studs to take full advantage of the resonant properties of the guitar.

### PRS Phase III Non-Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

With vintage elegance, these lightweight tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS 58/15 LT Pickups

“Low turn” pickups with vintage warm, clear tone.

# S2 Special Semi-Hollow Reclaimed Limited Edition

# Tell a New Story

“It is impossible to fool a good guitar player. Everyone who has a guitar made from these woods sees them as a legitimate tool for serious players, not as a gimmick.” – Michael Reid, PRS Guitars Senior Wood Buyer

This 700-piece limited edition showcases reclaimed and salvaged woods on one of our most versatile models: the S2 Special Semi-Hollow. With each top boasting its own character and left as natural as possible, every instrument is rendered unique. That character paired with a wide spectrum of tones – from articulate single-coil sparkle to full, vintage-inspired humbucking warmth – results in a truly special instrument.

The woods featured on this model include a Peroba Rosa top, Cuban mahogany neck, and Guaribu fretboard. Peroba Rosa, typically used as siding in Brazil, was selected for the top wood. The density of this 100-150 year old wood combined with the semi-hollow body construction gives the S2 Special Semi-Hollow Reclaimed Limited Edition a unique sound that is punchy but also warm and full. The Cuban mahogany used for the necks was purchased from Puerto Rico; some of this wood was salvaged from trees blown down by Hurricane Maria in 2017. Finally, the Guaribu Preto fretboards are sourced from Brazil, where this wood was historically used as support beams for houses. These guitars are left Natural in color and finished in satin nitro. Any nail holes, wear, or discoloration have been left in the top wood to showcase its history.

“Wood is a crucial element to our guitar making heritage. Michael Reid, our Senior Wood Buyer, has been my curly maple wood provider and buyer since 1980 - before PRS was officially PRS - and we still work together as partners today. The deep relationships Michael has formed worldwide with our wood suppliers are remarkable. Guitars like this are a great way to highlight some of the interesting, personal stories from his travels and musical wood understanding,” said Paul Reed Smith.

You can read more from Michael on our blog.

Beyond their unique wood appointments, these instruments maintain many of the S2 Special Semi-Hollow’s standard specifications, including a 22-fret, 25” scale length Pattern Regular neck and hum/Narrowfield/hum pickup configuration. A 5-way blade switch and two mini-toggles allow players to tap the humbuckers, creating twelve distinct pickup combinations and ensuring endless sonic exploration.

Only 700 S2 Special Semi-Hollow Reclaimed Limited Edition guitars will be made in 2025.

### PRS Patented Tremolo

Patented design, delivering tonal fidelity, player comfort, and tuning stability.

### PRS Phase III Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

# S2 Special Semi-Hollow Reclaimed Limited Edition

# Tell a New Story

“It is impossible to fool a good guitar player. Everyone who has a guitar made from these woods sees them as a legitimate tool for serious players, not as a gimmick.” – Michael Reid, PRS Guitars Senior Wood Buyer

This 700-piece limited edition showcases reclaimed and salvaged woods on one of our most versatile models: the S2 Special Semi-Hollow. With each top boasting its own character and left as natural as possible, every instrument is rendered unique. That character paired with a wide spectrum of tones – from articulate single-coil sparkle to full, vintage-inspired humbucking warmth – results in a truly special instrument.

The woods featured on this model include a Peroba Rosa top, Cuban mahogany neck, and Guaribu fretboard. Peroba Rosa, typically used as siding in Brazil, was selected for the top wood. The density of this 100-150 year old wood combined with the semi-hollow body construction gives the S2 Special Semi-Hollow Reclaimed Limited Edition a unique sound that is punchy but also warm and full. The Cuban mahogany used for the necks was purchased from Puerto Rico; some of this wood was salvaged from trees blown down by Hurricane Maria in 2017. Finally, the Guaribu Preto fretboards are sourced from Brazil, where this wood was historically used as support beams for houses. These guitars are left Natural in color and finished in satin nitro. Any nail holes, wear, or discoloration have been left in the top wood to showcase its history.

“Wood is a crucial element to our guitar making heritage. Michael Reid, our Senior Wood Buyer, has been my curly maple wood provider and buyer since 1980 - before PRS was officially PRS - and we still work together as partners today. The deep relationships Michael has formed worldwide with our wood suppliers are remarkable. Guitars like this are a great way to highlight some of the interesting, personal stories from his travels and musical wood understanding,” said Paul Reed Smith.

You can read more from Michael on our blog.

Beyond their unique wood appointments, these instruments maintain many of the S2 Special Semi-Hollow’s standard specifications, including a 22-fret, 25” scale length Pattern Regular neck and hum/Narrowfield/hum pickup configuration. A 5-way blade switch and two mini-toggles allow players to tap the humbuckers, creating twelve distinct pickup combinations and ensuring endless sonic exploration.

Only 700 S2 Special Semi-Hollow Reclaimed Limited Edition guitars will be made in 2025.

### PRS Patented Tremolo

Patented design, delivering tonal fidelity, player comfort, and tuning stability.

### PRS Phase III Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

# 40th Anniversary Custom 24 Limited Edition

# Celebrating The One That Started It All

Introducing the 40th Anniversary Custom 24 Limited Edition, celebrating four decades of PRS Guitars. Limited to 400 pieces worldwide, this special edition features both traditional design features and new appointments, making it an essential piece for serious musicians and collectors alike.

Built on the tried-and-true foundation of a mahogany back and neck with artist grade maple top, the 40th Anniversary Custom 24 boasts a retro violin top carve, PRS “Old School” birds with outlines, and PRS “Pre-Factory” headstock eagle, all of which pay homage to early PRS guitars. Outside of these aesthetic attributes, the 40th Anniversary Custom 24 is looking ahead with its all-new PRS DMO Treble and Bass pickups. DMO pickups (DMO standing for Dynamic, Musical, Open) were spec’d by Paul Reed Smith and the PRS New Products Engineering team to have a wide open sound with vocal character.

Other classic Custom 24 appointments include the PRS Gen III patented tremolo, PRS Phase III locking tuners with wing buttons, and PRS Signature 10-46 strings. This limited edition also features a ziricote fretboard and headstock veneer.

This commemorative run kicks off a year-long 40th Anniversary celebration for PRS Guitars. Only 400 of this 40th Anniversary Custom 24 Limited Edition will be available. Hand-signed 40th Anniversary certificate included.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo, Gen III

Meticulous design delivering sonic fidelity, player ergonomics, and revolutionary tuning stability.

### PRS Phase III Locking Tuners

Modern locking technology with vintage elegance, these tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS DMO Pickups

“Dynamic, Musical, Open” pickups with balanced tonal range and vocal quality.

# Custom 24 "Floyd"

# Designed For Destruction

The Custom 24 "Floyd" is equipped with the time-tested Floyd Rose "Original" tremolo system and PRS's \ m / (metal) pickups. The Floyd Rose "Original" tremolo and locking nut tuning system is a double-locking design precision-made from high quality steel. This design combination allows players to lock the string at the nut and at the bridge to keep the guitar in tune even during the heaviest dive-bombing sessions.

The Custom 24 is the quintessential PRS guitar. This iconic instrument was the first model that Paul Reed Smith brought to the public at PRS Guitars’ first Winter NAMM show in 1985 and has been a top seller ever since.

For 2024, PRS Guitars is updating the tuning machines on many of our Core guitars. While, aesthetically, our new Wing buttons are designed to echo the 12th fret bird wingspan design, they were first and foremost designed for tonal reasons all the way back in 1982. Because these buttons are lighter weight than their metal predecessors, they are subtracting less energy from the vibrating strings, thus helping the guitar ring longer and at a more musical note.

## Featured Specifications

### Floyd Rose Tremolo

Precision-made tremolo designed to keep the guitar in tune through even the heaviest dive-bombing sessions.

### PRS Phase III Non-Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

With vintage elegance, these lightweight tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS \m/ (Metal) Pickups

Designed with heavier styles in mind, PRS metal pickups bring aggressive and articulate tone.

# Custom 24

# The One That Started It All

The Custom 24 is the quintessential PRS guitar. This iconic instrument was the first model that Paul Reed Smith brought to the public at PRS Guitars’ first Winter NAMM show in 1985 and has been a top seller ever since. Played by internationally touring artists, gigging musicians, and aspiring players, the Custom 24 features PRS’s patented Gen III tremolo system and PRS 85/15 pickups with volume and tone controls and a 5-way blade switch. 85/15 pickups were personally designed by Paul Reed Smith to offer remarkable clarity and extended high and low end.

The Custom 24 is the original PRS. Since its introduction, it has offered a unique tonal option for serious players and defined PRS tone and playability.

For 2024, PRS Guitars is updating the tuning machines on many of our Core guitars. While, aesthetically, our new Wing buttons are designed to echo the 12th fret bird wingspan design, they were first and foremost designed for tonal reasons all the way back in 1982. Because these buttons are lighter weight than their metal predecessors, they are subtracting less energy from the vibrating strings, thus helping the guitar ring longer and at a more musical note.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo, Gen III

Meticulous design delivering sonic fidelity, player ergonomics, and revolutionary tuning stability.

### PRS Phase III Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

Modern locking technology with vintage elegance, these lightweight tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS 85/15 Pickups

Uncovered pickups with remarkable clarity and extended high and low end, perfect for more modern applications.

# Custom 24 Piezo

# 24 Frets, Infinite Range of Tones

The Custom 24 Piezo is a 24-fret solidbody piezo-equipped guitar that effortlessly achieves classic humbucker tones and authentic acoustic sounds in one instrument. The added versatility of PRS’s patented Gen III tremolo gives musicians a new and unique tool to add to their lineup.

The Custom 24 Piezo has two output jacks, allowing guitarists to plug into their favorite electric or acoustic guitar amp or DI into a soundboard. By utilizing the separate blend control, the tone of the 85/15 pickups can also be combined with the piezo acoustic sounds through a single output. With a nearly infinite range of tones and the added versatility and reliability of PRS’s proprietary tremolo bridge, the Custom 24 Piezo is a perfect “go-to” guitar for players of all kinds.

For 2024, PRS Guitars is updating the tuning machines on many of our Core guitars. While, aesthetically, our new Wing buttons are designed to echo the 12th fret bird wingspan design, they were first and foremost designed for tonal reasons all the way back in 1982.

## Accolades

"The Custom 24 Piezo is without a doubt the best and most versatile guitar I have ever owned. I play them every night live. The piezo system gives us that acoustic sound that we’ve been wanting for years. Our FOH soundman loves them and it makes us sound better without a doubt. I didn’t do any alterations to the specs either. It was perfect right out of the case.”

- Mikael Akerfeldt (Opeth)

# Custom 24-08

# Updated Icon

The Custom 24 is the quintessential PRS guitar, the iconic instrument that started it all back in 1985. The Custom 24-08 keeps many of the foundational specs as the original Custom – maple top, mahogany back and neck, 24 frets, 25” scale length, the PRS patented Gen III tremolo – but adds a new level of versatility with its TCI pickups and intuitive switching system. Featuring two mini-toggle coil-tap switches, the Custom 24-08 has eight different pickup settings that provide an array of humbucking and single coil tones, including a dual single coil option. For classic PRS playability, reliability, and tone with ultimate flexibility, check out the Custom 24-08.

For 2024, PRS Guitars is updating the tuning machines on many of our Core guitars. While, aesthetically, our new Wing buttons are designed to echo the 12th fret bird wingspan design, they were first and foremost designed for tonal reasons all the way back in 1982. Because these buttons are lighter weight than their metal predecessors, they are subtracting less energy from the vibrating strings, thus helping the guitar ring longer and at a more musical note.

# DGT

# Vintage Tone Out Of The Box

The DGT (David Grissom Trem) is the result of more than 20 years of collaboration between Paul Reed Smith and David Grissom. The DGT is based on the McCarty platform with a unique DGT neck shape, taller frets, special pickups, and a revised control layout. Grissom and Paul spent a year A/B-ing more than forty sets of pickups before nailing the vintage-voice of DGT humbuckers. When paired with individual volume controls for each pickup and a push/pull master tone control that operates the coil taps, DGT pickups provide versatility and articulation.

“The DGT is a product a lot of miles down the road: a lot of gigs, a lot of records. It’s like picking up a vintage guitar. It sounds like a vintage guitar, and out of the box it’s ready to go. There’s a whole lot of thought gone into this. The DGT is pretty perfect to me.” – David Grissom

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo, Gen III

Meticulous design delivering sonic fidelity, player ergonomics, and revolutionary tuning stability.

### PRS Phase III Locking Tuners

Modern locking technology with vintage elegance, these tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS DGT Pickups

Beautiful rhythm and solo tone with a Texas voice.

## Accolades

“At first glance, the DGT is pretty much what we’ve come to expect from PRS — meaning it’s flawless and gorgeous...You need to play the DGT to really grasp the Grissomization, however.”

- Guitar Player

“Swiss Army axe...”

# DGT Semi-Hollow Limited Edition

# Semi-Hollow, Fully Alive

“The limited run Semi Hollow DGT is based on a guitar I special ordered a few years back. The limited edition features moon inlays and a McCarty Sunburst finish. The semi-hollow design has a bit warmer top end and a little less bottom than the solid body, making it a super versatile companion to my stock DGTs.” – David Grissom

After many requests, the PRS DGT is now available as a semi-hollow instrument in this limited edition, based off one of David Grissom’s personal guitars. The tried-and-true foundation of the PRS DGT is maintained here, including the DGT neck shape, pickups, and dual volume control layout. The mahogany body with maple top features semi-hollow construction, giving the guitar increased resonance and lively tone.

The original DGT is based off of the McCarty platform and is the product of a decades-long collaboration between Paul Reed Smith and David Grissom. The vintage heart of this instrument is further embodied by the McCarty Sunburst finish and moon inlays. This limited edition is hand-signed by Paul Reed Smith on the front of the headstock and by David Grissom on the guitar’s backplate. Only 200 of the PRS DGT Semi-Hollow Limited Edition will be made in 2024.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo, Gen II

Meticulous design delivering sonic fidelity, player ergonomics, and revolutionary tuning stability.

### PRS Phase III Locking Tuners

Modern locking technology with vintage elegance, these tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS DGT Pickups

Beautiful rhythm and solo tone with a Texas voice.

# Hollowbody II Piezo

# Extraordinary Resonance

With brilliant acoustics and a vast array of tones, the Hollowbody II has been a constant favorite in our dynamic lineup of hollow instruments. The combination of the maple top and back with mahogany sides provides tonal clarity and extraordinary resonance.

The LR Baggs/PRS Piezo System comes standard, providing musicians with the versatility of wielding both acoustic and electric guitar tones in one instrument. There are two output jacks on the Hollowbody II Piezo, allowing guitarists to plug into their favorite electric guitar or acoustic guitar amp or DI into a soundboard. By utilizing the separate blend control, the tone of the Hollowbody II Piezo's 58/15 LT pickups can also be combined with acoustic sounds through a single output.

For 2024, PRS Guitars is updating the tuning machines on many of our Core guitars. While, aesthetically, our new Wing buttons are designed to echo the 12th fret bird wingspan design, they were first and foremost designed for tonal reasons all the way back in 1982. Because these buttons are lighter weight than their metal predecessors, they are subtracting less energy from the vibrating strings, thus helping the guitar ring longer and at a more musical note. The removal of the tuner’s locking feature on non-tremolo-equipped guitars further decreases their weight.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Adjustable 'Piezo' Stoptail

Including six individual piezo-equipped saddles, this bridge works with the LR Baggs/PRS proprietary piezo electronics, to effortlessly achieve electric and acoustic sounds in one instrument.

### PRS Phase III Non-Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

With vintage elegance, these lightweight tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS 58/15 LT Pickups

“Low turn” pickups with vintage warm, clear tone.

## Accolades

"Want sustain and tone that just keeps going....and going....and going, long enough to make Nigel forget what he started? Look no further than the Paul Reed Smith Hollowbody II electric."

- American Songwriter

"CAMILA’s music often goes from soft acoustic guitar arpeggios to power chords and leads, all within the same song. The PRS Hollowbody is my essential tool for achieving those changes in a live situation. I just love the sound of the Piezo and the Humbuckers. I even combine both sounds on some songs and the blend is beautiful. It’s like having two guitars in one. It quickly became my main axe."

- Pablo Hurtado, Camila

# Kanami Limited Edition

# Maid to Rock

“PRS has always been an essential part of BAND-MAID’s sound ever since I started playing the Custom 24. When thinking about the specs of my signature model, the control layout of the Custom 24-08 was the best choice as a base, because many BAND-MAID songs require the high E note on the 24th fret, and I often switch between humbucker and single-coil sounds. As for the color finish, I chose Trampas Green Burst. This is the color of my first PRS I bought when I decided to become a professional guitarist with BAND-MAID. One of my dreams to have my own signature model has come true here, and I would say this guitar is an extension of my first PRS. What an honor it is!” – KANAMI // BAND-MAID

The PRS Kanami Limited Edition is the first signature model for Kanami Tono of Japan’s hard-rock band: Band-Maid. Kanami is Band-Maid’s lead guitarist and has been playing PRS for more than a decade. This limited edition is based off her most recent PRS Custom 24-08 guitar but, most notably, boasts PRS’s 85/15 humbuckers and PRS Brushstroke birds.

PRS 85/15 pickups offer exceptional clarity with a full range of tones. The two mini-toggle coil-tap switches allow for powerful humbucking and crisp single-coil sounds in one instrument…a must when playing leads in hard rock and metal. More of Kanami’s personal appointment choices include a quilted maple top, ebony fretboard with Brushstroke Bird inlays, and smoked black hardware. Kanami also chose the visually striking stain color: Trampas Green Smokeburst. Ready to travel to any gig, the PRS Kanami Limited Edition ships in the new PRS ATA multi-fit molded case.

This limited edition is hand-signed by Kanami on the guitar’s backplate. Only 200 of the PRS Kanami Limited Edition will be made.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo, Gen III

Meticulous design delivering sonic fidelity, player ergonomics, and revolutionary tuning stability.

### PRS Phase III Locking Tuners

# Mark Tremonti Signature

# Aggressive, Articulate Tone

Mark Tremonti is one of rock’s leading guitarists. As the guitarist of Alter Bridge and Creed, he has met extraordinary success and continues to grow as both a guitar player and songwriter. While Creed was on tour in support of their first record, My Own Prison, Mark was contacted by PRS and asked if he would like to try one of their guitars.

"I jumped at the idea to play one of PRS’ guitars. PRS was one of those guitars that I could never afford in high school or college and had always wanted to play one." PRS sent Mark a McCarty model which he instantly fell in love with. He played that guitar exclusively for a while, but ultimately wanted a guitar that was more suited to his playing style.

Mark Tremonti began to collaborate with PRS on his dream guitar that would soon become the Mark Tremonti Signature. He needed pickups that were a little more aggressive and could complement his rhythm playing which contains a lot of palm muting. The neck of the guitar needed to accommodate his style, influenced by thrash metal, shred, and traditional blues. PRS met these needs with the Pattern Thin neck carve.

# McCarty

# A Legacy of Innovation

Named after Ted McCarty, a pioneer of the electric guitar and musical instrument industry, the McCarty model embodies the most up-to-date findings from PRS and looks back to the golden age of the guitar. This vintage-appointed guitar features a bound, 22-fret Pattern neck and a slightly thicker back for enhanced tone and sustain. The McCarty model is anchored by a PRS Stoptail bridge with brass inserts for added resonance and vintage-style tuners. The PRS McCarty is outfitted with McCarty LT treble and bass pickups. These vintage-style pickups exhibit exceptional clarity and focused midrange. Paired with a push/pull tone control and a 3-way toggle pickup switch, these pickups provide a complete palette of tones.

In the late 1980’s, Paul Reed Smith called on Ted McCarty to consult with him on guitar design and production techniques. He not only served as a mentor but became a great friend of Paul and everyone he met at PRS. In 1994, PRS released the first McCarty, an instrument that incorporated the full spectrum of techniques and knowledge Paul had gained from Ted as well as his own experiences as a guitar builder. “One of my sayings is that everything that touches the string is God – well, that’s really the bridge, the nut, and the tuners. So when we went after the McCarty model, that’s where we looked. These updates make a huge difference in the tone. The guitar sustains longer and the tone has more character,” said Paul Reed Smith. “The puzzle pieces all fit together, and there is no compromise to the integrity of the instrument.” For 2024, PRS Guitars is updating the tuning machines on many of our Core guitars. While, aesthetically, our new Wing buttons are designed to echo the 12th fret bird wingspan design, they were first and foremost designed for tonal reasons all the way back in 1982. Because these buttons are lighter weight than their metal predecessors, they are subtracting less energy from the vibrating strings, thus helping the guitar ring longer and at a more musical note. The removal of the tuner’s locking feature on non-tremolo-equipped guitars further decreases their weight.



## Featured Specifications

### PRS Stoptail with Brass Inserts

Engineered with curved string slots with brass inserts and brass studs to take full advantage of the resonant properties of the guitar.

### PRS Vintage-Style Non-Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

# McCarty 594

# Vintage Heart with Modern Playability

The McCarty 594 is a versatile, vintage-inspired instrument that is effortlessly playable. Featuring a bound 22-fret Pattern Vintage neck and slightly thicker back for more enhanced tone and sustain, the McCarty 594 plays in tune, is intonated the entire length of the neck, and feels like a guitar you’ve been playing forever. Whether you are looking for rich, authentic humbucking tones or nuanced, sweet single-coil sounds, the McCarty 594 can seamlessly master both sonic territories thanks to its 58/15 LT pickups, which have now been through the TCI (tuned capacitance and inductance) process, and dual volume and push/pull tone controls. A zinc two-piece bridge and vintage-style tuners anchor this guitar and stay true to the promise of the McCarty family.

“One of my sayings is that everything that touches the string is God – well, that’s really the bridge, the nut, and the tuners. The updates to the McCarty family make a huge difference in their tone. The guitar sustains longer and the tone has more character,” said Paul Reed Smith.

In the late 1980’s, Paul Reed Smith called on Ted McCarty to consult with him on guitar design and production techniques. He not only served as a mentor but became a great friend of Paul and everyone he met at PRS. In 1994, PRS released the first McCarty, an instrument that incorporated the full spectrum of techniques and knowledge Paul had gained from Ted as well as his own experiences as a guitar builder.

The removal of the tuner’s locking feature on non-tremolo-equipped guitars further decreases their weight.

### PRS Two-Piece Bridge

Made of zinc and brass, this bridge has four contact points and added mass, enhancing the natural tone of the guitar and helping to create a more resonant instrument.

### PRS Vintage-Style Non-Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

Traditional closed-back tuners engineered to promote resonance.

### PRS 58/15 LT Pickups

## Accolades

"The 594 is the best new guitar I've played in years. It has a vintage heart and soul but without the technical limitations that usually come along with an old instrument. What good is an old guitar if you can't get all that feel out of the upper frets, or the intonation is off? To hear that old PAF sound but be able to articulate the notes in a way that only modern manufacturing could allow is so exciting."

- John Mayer

"It's engineered beautifully and really lives up to the idea of getting the best attributes of an old instrument, I love the two volume/two tone layout, while still keeping the overall feel of a PRS. The pickups sound great and really have the vibe of old PAF's that aren't wound too hot."

- Jimmy Herring, Widespread Panic

"I could go on and on about how fabulous this thing sounds, how beautifully it plays and intonates, the exquisite workmanship, etc. Instead let me just say that I’ve played a lot of guitars in general and PRS guitars in particular...and this is one of the finest instruments I have ever encountered."

- Guitar Player

"The new McCarty 594 is extremely versatile. With individual volume, tone and coil tap pulls I’m able to create a wide enough variety of tones that it has minimized my guitar changes on this year’s Toby Keith Interstates & Tailgates tour to almost none!"

- Rich Eckhardt, Toby Keith

"So... you guys knocked this one out of the park. It’s... kinda freaking me out a bit. Causing me to re-think my touring set and I have only been playing it for two hours. I am not really sure what to say, I have two “Holy Grail” guitars that do most of my heavy lifting in the set, but this one is going to be banging it’s head to work its way in. I am a bit stunned. The 594 sounded like a good concept on paper, but....just wow. This is a killer."

- John Wesley Dearth, Porcupine Tree

# McCarty 594 Hollowbody II

# Vintage Resonance

The McCarty 594 Hollowbody II brings a new set of features to one of our most beloved models: the Hollowbody II. With fully-hollow construction, the Hollowbody II is a resonant guitar with warm, woody tone. The details carried over from the McCarty 594 model impart vintage character to this already classic instrument. 58/15 LT pickups, which have been through the TCI (tuned capacitance and inductance) process, ensure that these guitars are clear and musical while dual volume and push/pull tone controls offer plenty of versatility. The zinc two-piece bridge and vintage-style tuners anchor this guitar and stay true to the promise of the McCarty family.

Whether you are looking for rich, authentic humbucking tones or nuanced, sweet single-coil sounds, the McCarty 594 Hollowbody II can oblige. Additional appointments include, a bound, 22-fret, 24.594” scale length Pattern Vintage neck with rosewood fretboard and PRS trademark bird inlays.

“One of my sayings is that everything that touches the string is God – well, that’s really the bridge, the nut, and the tuners. The updates to the McCarty family make a huge difference in their tone. The guitar sustains longer and the tone has more character,” said Paul Reed Smith.

In the late 1980’s, Paul Reed Smith called on Ted McCarty to consult with him on guitar design and production techniques. He not only served as a mentor but became a great friend of Paul and everyone he met at PRS. In 1994, PRS released the first McCarty, an instrument that incorporated the full spectrum of techniques and knowledge Paul had gained from Ted as well as his own experiences as a guitar builder.

For 2024, PRS Guitars is updating the tuning machines on many of our Core guitars. While, aesthetically, our new Wing buttons are designed to echo the 12th fret bird wingspan design, they were first and foremost designed for tonal reasons all the way back in 1982. Because these buttons are lighter weight than their metal predecessors, they are subtracting less energy from the vibrating strings, thus helping the guitar ring longer and at a more musical note. The removal of the tuner’s locking feature on non-tremolo-equipped guitars further decreases their weight.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Two-Piece Bridge

Made of zinc and brass, this bridge has four contact points and added mass, enhancing the natural tone of the guitar and helping to create a more resonant instrument.

- Guitar Player

“Playing this guitar was a genuinely rewarding experience. While a little different from my usual setup, most players won’t be disappointed with the playability straight out of the gate.”

# McCarty 594 Singlecut

# Vintage Tone and Feel. Remarkable Playability.

The McCarty family of guitars is born from passion and precision: built passionately to embody vintage appointments and tone while utilizing the precision of PRS’s modern manufacturing techniques. Whether you are looking for rich, authentic humbucking tones or nuanced, sweet single-coil sounds, the McCarty Singlecut 594 can seamlessly master both sonic territories thanks to the 58/15 LT pickups and push/pull coil taps on the tone controls. The electronics layout, a few key specifications, and PRS craftsmanship combine in the McCarty Singlecut 594 to create an instrument that plays in tune, is intonated the entire length of the neck, and feels like a guitar that you’ve been playing forever.

The McCarty Singlecut 594 has been meticulously spec’d to deliver a familiar feel and warm, vintage tone, featuring a bound, 22-fret, 24.594” scale length Pattern Vintage neck, a slightly thicker back for enhanced tone and sustain, and 58/15 LT treble and bass pickups, which have been through the TCI (tuned capacitance and inductance) process. 58/15 LT pickups offer exceptional clarity, focused midrange, and vintage character. The McCarty Singlecut 594 model is anchored by a zinc two-piece stoptail bridge with brass saddles and studs for added resonance and vintage-style tuners.

“One of my sayings is that everything that touches the string is God – well, that’s really the bridge, the nut, and the tuners. The updates to the McCarty family make a huge difference in their tone. The guitar sustains longer and the tone has more character,” said Paul Reed Smith.

## Accolades

"The SC594 is literally the finest guitar I've ever played in my life. I can't even put it in words. I haven't put it down. There is a 'cut' and character in this guitar that I've been needing. It has a chime! Toby's music so 'complex' with so many things going on, I need CUT in my tones. Need to be able to rip a head off once in a while, but still have the warmth and character is guitarist and tone junkys need."

- Tim Rosenau, Toby Mac

"In conclusion, I like this guitar–a lot! I appreciate all the attention to detail that goes into a PRS before it leaves the factory. Fit, finish and playability are fantastic right there out of the box. For a traditional dual humbucker guitar, it offers up all the classic tones you expect and the coil-tap switches are a quite functional addition. This guitar exudes quality–quality of parts and quality of build. I highly recommend an audition if you are at all curious about what PRS achieved when they put their experience and quest for excellence towards updating a tried and true design."

# Modern Eagle V

# Innovation Realized

The Modern Eagle V is an innovative instrument that offers highly musical tones for both recording and playing live. Utilizing a hum/single/hum (five-coil) pickup layout and unique electronics configuration, the Modern Eagle V gives players a vast array of tones in one guitar. The 5-way blade switch selects the pickups in intuitive groupings: treble, treble and middle, middle, middle and bass, and bass. There is a single volume and a push/pull tone control that activates both humbuckers when engaged; this allows players to access all three pickups simultaneously. Finally, the mini toggles allow players to individually tap the humbucker coils, for additional single-coil sounds. This electronics design puts a whole set of classic and new tones at your fingertips.

Additional appointments include a maple top and mahogany back, a 22 fret, 25” scale length, Pattern mahogany neck with rosewood fretboard, bone nut, and PRS patented Gen III tremolo.

“Modern Eagle models have always been built to stand up to history while celebrating tonewoods and the discovery of new tones. The Modern Eagle V is a sophisticated instrument not only in its craftsmanship but in its electronic and mechanical design,” said Paul Reed Smith. “We’ve refined the pickup tones and are pleased to now add it to the Core lineup.”

For 2024, PRS Guitars is updating the tuning machines on many of our Core guitars. While, aesthetically, our new Wing buttons are designed to echo the 12th fret bird wingspan design, they were first and foremost designed for tonal reasons all the way back in 1982. Because these buttons are lighter weight than their metal predecessors, they are subtracting less energy from the vibrating strings, thus helping the guitar ring longer and at a more musical note.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo, Gen III

Meticulous design delivering sonic fidelity, player ergonomics, and revolutionary tuning stability.

### PRS Phase III Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

Modern locking technology with vintage elegance, these lightweight tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS MEV Pickups

Versatile pickup configuration offering a vast array of tones in one guitar.

With these pickups, I can move from a strong bridge pickup to a very clear, “whoopy” neck pickup – you can hear every note – by just setting the mini-toggles and using the 3-way as normal. It’s a highly musical and very usable setup. This guitar has clear, spanky single coils when you split the pickups but a very full soapbar quality when they are in humbucking mode. It’s just beautiful.” - Paul Reed Smith

Historically, the Paul’s Guitar (like the Modern Eagle before it) has been a realization of Paul Reed Smith’s latest discoveries surrounding tone. Paul specified every appointment of this instrument from the wood selection and inlay design to the pickups. This revamped model represents Paul’s vision not only as a guitar maker but as a guitar player who needs versatile stage - and studio-ready gear that can achieve all the right tones. As a man who has every option available to him, Paul’s personal design choices include mahogany bodies with maple tops, Honduran rosewood fretboards, Nitrocellulose finishes, “Brushstroke” bird inlays, and narrow pickup bobbins. The Paul’s Guitar model also includes PRS’s TCI (Tuned Capacitance and Inductance) treble and bass pickups with two mini-toggle switches that allow players to put either or both pickups in either humbucking or single coil mode.

For 2024, PRS Guitars is updating the tuning machines on many of our Core guitars. While, aesthetically, our new Wing buttons are designed to echo the 12th fret bird wingspan design, they were first and foremost designed for tonal reasons all the way back in 1982. Because these buttons are lighter weight than their metal predecessors, they are subtracting less energy from the vibrating strings, thus helping the guitar ring longer and at a more musical note. The removal of the tuner’s locking feature on non-tremolo-equipped guitars further decreases their weight.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Stoptail with Brass Inserts

Engineered with curved string slots with brass inserts and brass studs to take full advantage of the resonant properties of the guitar.

### PRS Phase III Non-Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

With vintage elegance, these lightweight tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS TCI Pickups

Musical pickups that offer versatile tones from spanky singlecoils to full soapbars.

# Santana Retro

# Celebrating History

Carlos Santana’s longstanding creative partnership with Paul Reed Smith has done much to shape the destiny of PRS Guitars. Over the years, we have honored this pivotal alliance by offering variations of his signature model instrument. The Santana Retro pays homage to the early “Pre-Factory” guitars Paul built for Carlos in the early 1980’s. Several unique design elements are reintroduced on this model, including a deeper body carve, original style heel, and the original headstock shape and nut placement. The Santana Retro blends history and modern manufacturing to create a highly musical guitar good enough for the man himself.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo, Gen III

Meticulous design delivering sonic fidelity, player ergonomics, and revolutionary tuning stability.

### PRS Phase III Locking Tuners

Modern locking technology with vintage elegance, these tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS Santana Pickups

Vintage-flavor pickups that deliver legendary clear, smooth tone.

# Special Semi-Hollow

# Explore Your Sound

The PRS Special Semi-Hollow offers players a versatile hum/”single”/hum configuration with two PRS 58/15 LT humbuckers and a PRS Narrowfield middle pickup. PRS Narrowfield pickups deliver the bite of a single coil, so they cut through the mix with plenty of clarity and punch – without the hum. Paired with a 5-way blade switch and two mini-toggles that tap the 58/15 LT humbuckers, this guitar can handle myriad sounds and styles (with twelve pickup combinations in total). Roll back the tone control for added growl, turn it up for some shimmer, and have fun exploring this versatile tonal palette. The volume level between the humbucking and single-coil settings remain very even, and the semi-hollow body with single f-hole provides a welcome airiness and depth to the guitar’s tone.

Additional specifications include a maple top, mahogany back, 22-fret 25” scale length mahogany neck, rosewood fretboard, Phase III locking tuners with wing buttons, and the PRS Gen III patented tremolo.

For 2024, PRS Guitars is updating the tuning machines on many of our Core guitars. While, aesthetically, our new Wing buttons are designed to echo the 12th fret bird wingspan design, they were first and foremost designed for tonal reasons all the way back in 1982. Because these buttons are lighter weight than their metal predecessors, they are subtracting less energy from the vibrating strings, thus helping the guitar ring longer and at a more musical note.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo, Gen III

Meticulous design delivering sonic fidelity, player ergonomics, and revolutionary tuning stability.

### PRS Phase III Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

## Accolades

“It has a resonant acoustic sound, and the pickups do a fine job of capturing that airy character at all volume levels, particularly when the guitar is up loud enough to enjoy the singing, edge-of-feedback sustain that semi-hollows do so well.”

# Studio

# Single Coil Snap & Humbucking Power

The PRS Studio model is a modern take on a traditional single-single-hum guitar. With PRS’s proprietary Narrowfield pickups in the middle and bass positions and a 58/15 LT humbucking treble pickup, the PRS Studio offers punchy singlecoils, vintage scooped tones, and the chunky kick of a treble humbucker screaming in one instrument. This whole new scope of sounds (that are only possible with a three-pickup guitar) are easily accessible in the Studio model thanks to the push/pull tone control and 5-way blade switch. With seven combinations in all, the PRS Studio covers classic tones but maintains a unique voice making it a perfect “desert island” guitar.

For 2024, PRS Guitars is updating the tuning machines on many of our Core guitars. While, aesthetically, our new Wing buttons are designed to echo the 12th fret bird wingspan design, they were first and foremost designed for tonal reasons all the way back in 1982. Because these buttons are lighter weight than their metal predecessors, they are subtracting less energy from the vibrating strings, thus helping the guitar ring longer and at a more musical note.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo, Gen III

### PRS Phase III Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

Modern locking technology with vintage elegance, these lightweight tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS 58/15 LT Pickups

“Low turn” pickups with vintage warm, clear tone.

## Accolades

"It sounds to us less about copping the sound of a '60s Strat with a hot PAF at the bridge, and more about offering a broad spectrum of fully hum-cancelling voices that sound classy and sophisticated played clean and really quite huge but defined with some crunch and gain. Factor in the feel, the neck shape and the ergonomics and it’s like the best vintage guitar you’ve never owned, certainly not at this price anyway."

# "Dead Spec" Silver Sky

# A Modded Version of Mayer’s Signature Axe

The PRS “Dead Spec” Silver Sky was designed for John Mayer’s prominent work with Dead & Company’s last tour. Paying homage to Jerry Garcia’s iconic “Alligator” guitar tones, the Dead Spec Silver Sky is a modded version of Mayer’s signature axe with significant spec changes.

The foundation of the “Dead Spec” Silver Sky is a lightweight Swamp Ash body (rather than alder) finished in Moc Sand satin nitro that is thin and strikingly sinks into the ash wood grain. The bridge is a modified PRS patented Gen III Tremolo that has been screwed to the body, effectively rendering it a string-through hardtail bridge. Keeping the tremolo’s brass block in the equation adds a musical warmth to the guitar. At the other end of the strings are a brass nut and string retainer bar, which also contribute to the guitar’s resonance and tone.

Perhaps most notably, the Dead Spec Silver Sky’s jack plate has been swapped out for a brass-plate Alembic Blaster preamp. This preamp can be used as a straight boost but has an internal pot that allows players to add between 3-14 dB of gain to the guitar when turned on. This not only gives the Dead Spec Silver Sky added punch while maintaining crisp note separation, but it compensates for the capacitance that comes with long stage cables as well.

The circuit is bypassed when in the off position. Only 1,000 PRS “Dead Spec” Silver Skys will be made. Shipping November 2023 – March 2024.

“After playing the Silver Sky designed for the 2023 Dead & Company summer tour, I realized the guitar was special. It quickly became apparent this wasn’t just a tool for one particular job but could be extremely versatile in other players’ hands. I’m excited to hear the music that’s made on these guitars.” – John Mayer

## Featured Specifications

### Surface-Mounted Bridge

Essentially a hardtail adaptation of the PRS patented tremolo, this bridge adds warmth and promotes the resonance of the guitar.

### Brass Nut/Retainer Bar

The brass nut and retainer bar bring warm, piano-like tone while promoting string vibration and resonance.

### Alembic Blaster

This preamp increases output with 3-14dB of adjustable gain and lowers the effective capacitance of your cable, so you can play with courage.

# CE 24

# Addictive Bolt-on Feel

Since the dawn of rock and roll, the snap and response that comes from a bolt-on neck guitar has been an essential part of the mix. These attributes have, in turn, become essential to many players trying to tell their story through music. The CE 24 pairs PRS’s traditional body combination of the mahogany back and maple top with a bolt-on maple neck and rosewood fretboard. The neck sports a Pattern Thin carve and satin nitro finish for a natural, addictive feel. To further maximize the guitar’s inherent tone and clarity, the CE 24 features PRS 85/15 pickups, which Paul designed to have remarkable clarity as well as extended high and low end. The electronics consist of a volume and push/pull tone control with 3-way toggle switch for a total of six classic sounds.

The original CE was introduced in 1988 and offered players PRS design and quality with the added snap and sparkle of traditional bolt-on guitars.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo

## Accolades

"Ultimately, the CE 24 begs for a test drive, especially by skeptics. This isn’t the first PRS that’s forged a bridge between differing solidbody designs, but it’s also its own animal – a serious professional instrument that can cover all the bases...a formidable piece of American guitar-making.”

- Vintage Guitar

"...there’s a character here that leans just a little towards a good Fender, a percussive edge or subtle flavor that is what attracted so many of us to those original CEs..."

- Guitarist

"If you're looking for something a little different but still want a high-quality US-built guitar with a lot of versatility, excellent ergonomics and playability and great looks too, but want it all at a reasonably realistic price that's low enough that you'll actually use the guitar instead of putting it into a glass case and just staring at it, check out the return of the Paul Reed Smith CE 24."

- Harmony Central

"Sonically, the CE 24 hit all of the marks...Exploring all the options would probably have taken me days (or weeks), and I doubt I’d find a tone that the CE 24 couldn’t emulate effectively.”

- Guitar Player

"If I were the type to limit myself to just one guitar (hint: I’m not), I could easily do an entire gig with just the CE24 running from classic rock, to indie rock, to alt-country, and on."

- Tone Report

“If you are on the hunt for endless tone options and value beautiful design, look no further; the CE 24 might just be your new favorite axe.”

- She Shreds

"The CE24 was a total game changer for me. Its sleek design allows me to reach every note and chord with ease, while the 85/15 pickups allow me to truly express the tone I'm after whether it's clean or crunchy."

- Dylan Bowman, I Prevail

# DW CE 24 “Floyd”

# Versatile Aggression

“This model has been the most stable, pleasure-to-play instrument I’ve ever had. I’ve put it through the paces, and it’s made me proud to have my name on it.” – Dustie Waring, Between the Buried & Me

The DW CE 24 "Floyd" model starts with the PRS CE bolt-on platform and includes a satin-finished maple neck, maple fretboard, a slightly modified Pattern Thin neck carve (Waring’s carve is slightly thinner front to back), and Floyd Rose tremolo system. The pickups and electronics are also unique to Waring’s signature axe. The pickups are Waring’s signature Mojotone Dustie Waring Gen 2 Tomahawk pickups. Made with superior quality Alnico 5 magnets and a special winding technique, Mojotone Dustie Waring Gen 2 Tomahawks have plenty of output and big bottom end while remaining articulate and clear - a unique quality for high-gain pickups. Paired with a volume and tone control and 5-way blade pickup selector that have been shifted slightly to allow plenty of room to work the tremolo, the DW CE 24 “Floyd” is comfortable, fun, and inspiring to play. The DW CE 24 “Floyd” comes with satin black hardware and is available in multiple color options, including Waring’s signature finish: Waring Wraparound Burst.



## Featured Specifications

### Floyd Rose 1000 Tremolo w/ Locking Nut

Low-profile design. Made to stay in tune through the heaviest dive-bombing sessions.

### Low-Mass Locking Tuners

# Fiore

# Play in Full Bloom

“All guitarists have a sound in their head – a sound that evolves and grows as they progress, discovering all of the beautiful idiosyncrasies that define their individual voice. To facilitate this process, players need a vibrant, dynamic guitar that becomes a free space in which their personality can unfold. PRS and I designed Fiore (Italian for ‘flower’) to be this guitar.” – Mark Lettieri

The PRS Fiore model continues PRS Guitars’ journey into the bolt-on, single-coil guitar world. Developed with guitarist, composer, producer, and instructor Mark Lettieri, the PRS Fiore offers a modern aesthetic, effortless playability, and an addictive and sophisticated tonal canvas.

The PRS Fiore pickups were carefully voiced by Lettieri and PRS to allow players a platform to explore and find their voice. The Fiore-S single coil offers exceptional malleability in tone. Capable of capturing all the articulation found in everything from whisper-quiet melodies to full on funk and rock explosivity, this pickup reacts to each player's unique approach.

The Fiore-H humbucker fulfills Lettieri’s desire for extensive versatility in the treble position: enough power and punch for high-gain lead tones, but with a smooth top end that allows the pickup to be played clean, even with the volume knob wide open. Both the Fiore-S and -H work seamlessly together, producing balance, clarity, and that elusive ‘bloom’ in all five positions.

But the tone exploration doesn’t stop there. The Fiore model features a 5-way blade switch with traditional wiring (bridge / bridge + middle / middle / middle + neck / neck). The Fiore also features a single volume and two push/pull tone controls, which further adds to this guitar’s tone-shaping abilities.

Lettieri brought several personal design choices to this model, including a custom truss rod cover drawn by his very own mom. Other appointments include a Swamp Ash body, 22 fret maple neck with maple fretboard, and 25.5” scale length for classic look and feel.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS 2-Point Steel Tremolo

Comfortable tremolo functionality with exceptional tuning stability, featuring a classic 2-point mounting system.

### Vintage-Style, Locking Tuners

Traditional vintage style, closed back tuners outfitted with PRS’s locking system.

### PRS Fiore-H and -S

Single/Single/Hum design delivering balance and clarity that blooms in all five positions.

# Myles Kennedy

Introducing Myles Kennedy’s first signature model. Known for his work in Alter Bridge, Slash and the Conspirators, and his own solo recordings, Kennedy is an accomplished guitarist who brings blues and jazz style to rock guitar playing. This new signature model mirrors Kennedy’s rock sensibilities with a nod to historic designs. While the aesthetic may have players hearing chicken pickin’ in their heads – and this guitar can certainly reach twang territory – it is made to play like a rock machine.

“This guitar captures the spirit of my favorite older instruments. With that said, since we developed this guitar, most of my vintage instruments rarely see the light of day,” said Kennedy.

The PRS Myles Kennedy signature guitar features a swamp ash body, a 22-fret, 25.5” scale length maple neck with maple fretboard, and two PRS Narrowfield MK pickups. The PRS Narrowfield MK pickups were carefully voiced to capture the courage of humbuckers and the spank of single coils. PRS Narrowfields provided the perfect starting point for this design, with their ability to deliver thick single-coil sounds without the hum. These pickups are paired with a 5-way blade switch and a push/pull tone control that acts as a preset tone roll- off, bringing down the higher frequencies on the treble pickup so you can dig in to the fullest.

“I watched Myles throughout his career alternate between humbucking and single coil sounds without giving anything up on either side. These pickups took us months to dial in, and I think they capture that balance that Myles mastered beautifully,” said Paul Reed Smith.

Other features include a PRS plate-style steel bridge, vintage-style locking tuners, bone nut, and Kennedy’s “Geometric Owl” logo from his “Ides of March” solo release, representing wisdom and adaptability.

“I feel like we managed to touch on the elusive quality that makes you want to play with this guitar. It beckons you to take it off the wall or out of the case and make music.” – Myles Kennedy

## Featured Specifications

# NF 53

The PRS NF 53 is a powerful guitar that combines classic tones with modern design. Inspired by one of Paul Reed Smith’s vintage guitars from 1953, the PRS NF 53 combines a swamp ash body and 22-fret, 25.5” scale length bolt-on maple neck with maple fretboard with a special set of PRS Narrowfield pickups. The PRS Narrowfield DD (Deep Dish) pickups are made with taller bobbins to fit more winds and extra metal pieces in between the magnets for a more focused, powerful tone.

“I am so pleased with the feedback from the artists who have played this guitar – everyone is telling us that we have something special here,” said Paul Reed Smith. “If you are a fan of this style and tone, the NF 53 will take you where you want to go. To me to have this kind of beautiful high end without the hum is game changing.”

Paired with a volume and tone control and 3-way blade pickup switch, the NF 53 allows players to easily dial in their sound. The steel plate-style bridge, PRS vintage style tuners, and nickel hardware all work together to provide precise and reliable tuning stability while promoting sustain and powerful tone.

Whether you are a seasoned player or just starting out, the PRS NF 53 is an addictive guitar you won’t want to put down.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Plate-Style Bridge, Steel

Plate-style design made with steel for lively tone and brass saddles for sustain and tuning fidelity.

### PRS Vintage-Style Non-Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

Traditional closed-back tuners engineered to promote resonance.

### PRS Narrowfield DD Pickups

“Deep Dish” pickups with a mixed magnet/steel pole piece design that deliver musical highs without losing bass and becoming anemic.

## Accolades

“Having been a huge fan of PRS for many years, I was ecstatic to hear about the NF53 model. Once I got my hands on it, it quickly became my favorite guitar I have ever played. The playability, per PRS standards, is second to none and I’ve never encountered a more versatile instrument. It has everything I could ever need or want from an electric guitar. Twangy and beefy…smooth and crystal clear: the NF 53 is a total game changer! PRS have knocked it out of the park yet again!”

- Trey Hensley

“The NF 53 can scream, twang, or sing with subtlety. It’s responsive and touch sensitive—the notes are simply jumping out of this thing. On the stage and in the studio, getting single coil tones with zero hum thanks to the Narrowfield pickups is a game changer. The neck is the perfect amount of chunk. It can more than handle any gig and it’s just a blast to play.”

- Rick Lollar

“As a professional musician, I have played countless guitars over the years. From the moment I picked up the new NF53, I knew I was holding something special. The body pays tribute to the classic Telecaster design but with modern contours that make it more comfortable. The neck is smooth, comfortable, and the playability is exceptional. The pickups deliver a modern, punchy tone that's perfect for rock, blues or jazz, but it still retains that classic Tele twang. I can’t recommend the NF53 enough. It’s a top-quality instrument that's perfect for any serious musician.”

- Mike Seal

“Absolutely blown away! As a huge fan of T style guitars, this checks all the boxes. It can twang, it can rock - I’d take this on any gig that got thrown my way knowing I could cover tons of ground with it. As I’ve come to expect from every PRS - exceptional fit and finish and plays like a dream!”

- Seth Rosenbloom

“The new PRS NF 53 is as fun to play as it is to look at. A modern take on a classic. The feel of this guitar is as comfortable as I’ve come to expect from PRS and the tone is warm, woody and articulate. It has immediately found a home in my arsenal as a go to guitar and I have no reason to believe that will change anytime soon!”

- Kevin Arrowsmith, Luke Bryan

"What more need be said: the NF53 simply blew me away…and continues to every time I plug in! This is an exciting chapter in the PRS story and one you need to check out! Congratulations to Paul and staff - well done!

- Dan Weller, Tyler Hubbard

# Silver Sky Maple

# Reach For The Sky

“It’s been a dream of mine for years to design a guitar that includes some of my favorite vintage specifications but with a modern spirit and aesthetic. After two years of study and refinement, the Silver Sky is my vision of what a reboot of the electric guitar should look and feel like.” – John Mayer

The PRS Silver Sky is an idealized version of a vintage single-coil guitar where every detail adds up and sets this guitar apart from the pack and the past. The result of a close collaboration between Grammy Award-winning musician John Mayer and Paul Reed Smith, the Silver Sky is based off of years of development. Incorporating Mayer and Smith’s favorite elements of 1963 and 1964 instruments with an eye toward modern references, the PRS Silver Sky delivers the warmth and familiarity of an old guitar with the finesse of a brand-new instrument.

Some of the more distinctive specifications include, the headstock shape, tuners, bridge, pickups, and neck and fretboard options. The headstock shape is based on PRS’s trademark design, but inverted both to accommodate Mayer’s playing style and also to keep a consistent length of string behind the nut, which makes staying in tune easier. The tuners are a traditional vintage-style, closed-back tuner, but with PRS’s locking design. The steel tremolo takes the patented PRS design and incorporates Gen III knife-edge screws. Setup flush to the body in the neutral position so that the tremolo bridge only goes down in pitch, the bridge’s increased contact with the body allows the guitar itself to be acoustically louder, which in turn improves the signal to noise ratio of the single-coil pickups. The 635JM single-coil pickups are very round and full, with a musical high end that is never “ice-picky” or brash.

The Silver Sky comes with the option of a rosewood or maple fretboard. The maple fretboard option comes with the original 635JM neck shape, while the rosewood fretboard option has been subtly modified in the shoulders to feel more “rounded” in your hand. Both neck shapes were designed by researching vintage instruments and Mayer test-driving guitars on stage to find what felt right. The fretboard radius on both options is 7.25”.

Other high-quality specifications include a bone nut, a molded metal jack plate (curved to make plugging and unplugging a guitar cable hassle-free), retooled knobs, and PRS’s double action truss rod (accessible from the front of the headstock for ease of use). PRS premium gig bag included.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Steel Tremolo

Classic design updated with PRS Gen III knife-edge screws and PRS’s trem arm design.

### Vintage-Style, Locking Tuners

Traditional vintage style, closed back tuners outfitted with PRS’s locking system.

### PRS 635JM

## Accolades

- Premier Guitar

“[The PRS Silver Sky] offers up shockingly good vintage tones and feel, but modern production methods and PRS’s legendary attention to detail have eliminated all the problems that go along with vintage instruments…including the monstrous price tag!”

- Guitar Interactive

“Tonally, it’s big, clear, and airy when played clean, and fat and resonant with overdrive kicked on…There’s so much to dig with this guitar, but most are sure to keep going back to that heel and amazing upper-fret reach, which changes everything.”

- Vintage Guitar

“After playing the Silver Sky, it’s easy to understand why it took so long to design and why John Mayer embraced this endeavor. For aficionados of the classic three single-coil pickup solidbody guitar design, this is truly one of the finest examples ever produced.”

- Guitar World

“A superb vintage and experience-informed three single-coil bolt-on. Build playability, sound and typical PRS attention to detail and quality.”

- Music Radar

"Bottom line: The Silver Sky absolutely delivers on the promise of being a damn-near-perfect version of this type of guitar…Paul Reed Smith doesn’t mess around, and you’ve got to assume that he never would have made this guitar if he didn’t think he could bring something inspiring to the party.”

- Guitar Player

“This is not simply a Strat with a PRS headstock. As Paul Reed Smith pointed out in an interview, every aspect of the guitar was thoughtfully designed, or redesigned. But don’t just take our word for it. Try one out. You may be just as impressed as we are.”

- MusicPlayers.com

"This guitar isn't designed to be just a collector's item that is hung on a wall to look at, it was built to be played and pushed to the limit."

- Maverick Magazine

“You can take as many modern or vintage twists as you want on an instrument. The real question is: does it work on stage or in the studio? Silver Sky works.”

- Clay Cook, Zac Brown Band

“Man I am hooked on this Silver Sky. Can’t stop playing it! The feel and dynamics are really next level.”

- Eric Krasno

“The Silver Sky is the closest anyone has ever come to bettering Leo's original blueprint for the Stratocaster.”

# Silver Sky Rosewood

# Reach For The Sky

“It’s been a dream of mine for years to design a guitar that includes some of my favorite vintage specifications but with a modern spirit and aesthetic. After two years of study and refinement, the Silver Sky is my vision of what a reboot of the electric guitar should look and feel like.” – John Mayer

The PRS Silver Sky is an idealized version of a vintage single-coil guitar where every detail adds up and sets this guitar apart from the pack and the past. The result of a close collaboration between Grammy Award-winning musician John Mayer and Paul Reed Smith, the Silver Sky is based off of years of development. Incorporating Mayer and Smith’s favorite elements of 1963 and 1964 instruments with an eye toward modern references, the PRS Silver Sky delivers the warmth and familiarity of an old guitar with the finesse of a brand-new instrument.

Some of the more distinctive specifications include, the headstock shape, tuners, bridge, pickups, and neck and fretboard options. The headstock shape is based on PRS’s trademark design, but inverted both to accommodate Mayer’s playing style and also to keep a consistent length of string behind the nut, which makes staying in tune easier. The tuners are a traditional vintage-style, closed-back tuner, but with PRS’s locking design. The steel tremolo takes the patented PRS design and incorporates Gen III knife-edge screws. Setup flush to the body in the neutral position so that the tremolo bridge only goes down in pitch, the bridge’s increased contact with the body allows the guitar itself to be acoustically louder, which in turn improves the signal to noise ratio of the single-coil pickups. The 635JM single-coil pickups are very round and full, with a musical high end that is never “ice-picky” or brash.

The Silver Sky comes with the option of a rosewood or maple fretboard. The maple fretboard option comes with the original 635JM neck shape, while the rosewood fretboard option has been subtly modified in the shoulders to feel more “rounded” in your hand. Both neck shapes were designed by researching vintage instruments and Mayer test-driving guitars on stage to find what felt right. The fretboard radius on both options is 7.25”.

Other high-quality specifications include a bone nut, a molded metal jack plate (curved to make plugging and unplugging a guitar cable hassle-free), retooled knobs, and PRS’s double action truss rod (accessible from the front of the headstock for ease of use). PRS premium gig bag included.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Steel Tremolo

Classic design updated with PRS Gen III knife-edge screws and PRS’s trem arm design.

### Vintage-Style, Locking Tuners

Traditional vintage style, closed back tuners outfitted with PRS’s locking system.

### PRS 635JM

Full, warm vintage-inspired single coils with a musical high-end that is never “ice-picky” or brash.

## Accolades

- Premier Guitar

“[The PRS Silver Sky] offers up shockingly good vintage tones and feel, but modern production methods and PRS’s legendary attention to detail have eliminated all the problems that go along with vintage instruments…including the monstrous price tag!”

- Guitar Interactive

“Tonally, it’s big, clear, and airy when played clean, and fat and resonant with overdrive kicked on…There’s so much to dig with this guitar, but most are sure to keep going back to that heel and amazing upper-fret reach, which changes everything.”

- Vintage Guitar

“After playing the Silver Sky, it’s easy to understand why it took so long to design and why John Mayer embraced this endeavor. For aficionados of the classic three single-coil pickup solidbody guitar design, this is truly one of the finest examples ever produced.”

- Guitar World

“A superb vintage and experience-informed three single-coil bolt-on. Build playability, sound and typical PRS attention to detail and quality.”

- Music Radar

"Bottom line: The Silver Sky absolutely delivers on the promise of being a damn-near-perfect version of this type of guitar…Paul Reed Smith doesn’t mess around, and you’ve got to assume that he never would have made this guitar if he didn’t think he could bring something inspiring to the party.”

- Guitar Player

“This is not simply a Strat with a PRS headstock. As Paul Reed Smith pointed out in an interview, every aspect of the guitar was thoughtfully designed, or redesigned. But don’t just take our word for it. Try one out. You may be just as impressed as we are.”

- MusicPlayers.com

"This guitar isn't designed to be just a collector's item that is hung on a wall to look at, it was built to be played and pushed to the limit."

- Maverick Magazine

“You can take as many modern or vintage twists as you want on an instrument. The real question is: does it work on stage or in the studio? Silver Sky works.”

- Clay Cook, Zac Brown Band

“Man I am hooked on this Silver Sky. Can’t stop playing it! The feel and dynamics are really next level.”

- Eric Krasno

“The Silver Sky is the closest anyone has ever come to bettering Leo's original blueprint for the Stratocaster.”

- Mixdown Monthly

# S2 Custom 24

# Fresh, Versatile Tone

The S2 Custom 24 takes the original PRS guitar, the Custom 24, and re-imagines it with stripped-down features and a new aesthetic. Retaining the classic maple top/mahogany back combination with our classic body shape and an asymmetrical beveled top, this guitar has a resonant, powerful voice. Its versatility comes from its Maryland, USA-wound 85/15 pickups and 5-way blade switch, offering all the same sounds as the flagship Custom 24. Familiar for PRS players of old, and a fresh take for players of all types.

After ten years, the PRS S2 Series is being updated with USA-made pickup and electronics for 2024 (and beyond). We are proud to bring this added value to what has become a fully integrated part of our manufacturing line and product offering.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo

Patented design, delivering tonal fidelity, player comfort, and tuning stability.

### Low-Mass Locking Tuners

## Accolades

"From the second I plugged in the PRS Custom 24, I felt as if I've never had so much power being a guitarist. Its original unique sound is unmatched by any other guitar on the market!!! It has the most full tone of any guitar ever, and that's just stock. I now consider it as an extension of my body... Hell, I even sleep with the thing... (TRUTH)”

- Bryce Klemer, Pacific Dub

"When you're on the road every day, it takes a toll on your gear. These guitars are by far the best I have used PERIOD! Day in day out my S2 Custom 24 performs as it should. I beat this thing to death, literally, and it still stays in tune and sounds amazing!”

- David Whitaker, Another Lost Year

"Personally, with our style of music and our live show, the weight and feel of my S2 Custom 24 is the perfect guitar for me. Absolutely the best guitar I've ever owned, amazing tone, and takes a beating, you'll have to pry it out of my hands, and I hold on for life.”

- Clinton Cunanan, Another Lost Year

"My S2 is my work horse, both live and in the studio. It's got the tonal versatility which sets PRS apart, and the quality of workmanship which means it effortlessly withstands the sweat and the knocks of our live show. I wouldn't be without it anywhere.”

- Simon Delaney, Don Broco

# S2 McCarty 594

# Vintage Inspiration with Rock-Solid Design

The S2 McCarty 594 is a versatile, vintage-inspired instrument that delivers both humbucking and single-coil tones in a modern, reliable package. Featuring a bound 22-fret Pattern Vintage neck and slightly thicker back for more sustain, the S2 McCarty 594 feels and sounds like a guitar you’ve been playing forever. A zinc two-piece bridge and vintage-style tuners anchor this guitar and stay true to the promise of the McCarty family.

Loaded with Maryland, USA-made 58/15 LT pickups, the S2 McCarty 594 has a warm, vintage-inspired tone. Whether you are looking for authentic humbucking tones or nuanced, sweet single-coil sounds, the S2 McCarty 594 can seamlessly master both sonic territories thanks to both the pickups and dual volume and push/pull tone control layout.

Designed to capture the heart of the McCarty family of instruments and stay true to the S2 Series spirit, the S2 McCarty 594 is a guitar your arsenal deserves.

After ten years, the PRS S2 Series is being updated with USA-made pickup and electronics for 2024 (and beyond). We are proud to bring this added value to what has become a fully integrated part of our manufacturing line and product offering. We have also updated our Vintage-Style tuners to include a new “Wing” button. While, aesthetically, these new buttons are designed to echo the 12th fret bird wingspan design, they were first and foremost designed for tonal reasons. Because these buttons are lighter weight than their metal predecessors, they are subtracting less energy from the vibrating strings, thus helping the guitar ring longer and at a more musical note. The removal of the tuner’s locking feature on non-tremolo-equipped guitars further decreases their weight.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Two-Piece Bridge

Made of zinc and brass, this bridge has four contact points and added mass, enhancing the natural tone of the guitar and helping to create a more resonant instrument.

### PRS Vintage-Style Non-Locking Tuners with Wing Buttons

Traditional closed-back tuners engineered to promote resonance.

### PRS 58/15 LT Pickups

“Low turn” pickups with vintage warm, clear tone.

# S2 McCarty 594 Thinline

# Gig-Ready Power

The S2 McCarty 594 Thinline is an all-mahogany, thin-body guitar with a powerful voice. Whether you are looking for authentic humbucking tones or nuanced, sweet single-coil sounds, the S2 McCarty 594 Thinline can seamlessly master both sonic territories thanks to its Maryland, USA-made 58/15 LT pickups and dual volume and push/pull tone controls.

The S2 McCarty 594 Thinline is addictive to play, thanks in part to its all-mahogany body, versatile control layout, and bound 22-fret Pattern Thin neck. The distinctive, powerful voice is backed by modern construction, so it plays in tune, stays in tune, and is intonated the entire length of the neck. A zinc two-piece bridge and vintage-style tuners anchor this guitar and stay true to the promise of the McCarty family.

Designed to capture the heart of the McCarty family of instruments and stay true to the S2 Series spirit, the S2 McCarty 594 Thinline stands on its own as a gig-ready workhorse for the player who wants to cover a lot of musical ground.

After ten years, the PRS S2 Series is being updated with USA-made pickup and electronics for 2024 (and beyond). We are proud to bring this added value to what has become a fully integrated part of our manufacturing line and product offering. We have also updated our Vintage-Style tuners to include a new “Wing” button.

# S2 Standard 22

# Bare-Bones Workhorse

The S2 Standard 22 is a workhorse guitar for gigging musicians, toneful enough to stand up plugged straight into an amplifier and solid enough to serve as a great platform for even the most modern pedal board set up. The S2 Standard 22’s solid mahogany body and set neck give this guitar a distinctive resonance and powerful sustain, and when mahogany’s rich, round, warm tone meets the Maryland, USA-made 58/15 LT pickups, there are plenty of clear highs and strong mids to be dialed in. For the player who wants to cover a lot of ground with their music, the S2 Standard 22 is a perfect choice.

After ten years, the PRS S2 Series is being updated with USA-made pickup and electronics for 2024 (and beyond). We are proud to bring this added value to what has become a fully integrated part of our manufacturing line and product offering.

## Accolades

"The question in every cynical mind is 'so, where have the corners been cut?' And the answer is 'they haven't. They're just cleverly made'.”

- Interactive Guitar Magazine

"Flexible all-round guitar for advanced and professionals who put their focus on less pompous appearance, but more to a rich tone and want spending less money properly.” (review link - review in German)

- Delamar

# S2 Standard 24

# Bare-Bones Workhorse

With its solid build and versatile electronics platform, the S2 Standard 24 is a true player’s guitar that handles as well as it sounds whether it’s plugged straight into your amp or run through your pedal board. The S2 Standard 24’s solid mahogany body and set neck give this guitar a distinctive resonance and powerful sustain, and when mahogany’s rich, round, warm tone meets the Maryland, USA-made 58/15 LT pickups, there are plenty of clear highs and strong mids to be dialed in. The subtle aesthetic of mahogany and vintage vibe of pickguard-mounted electronics give the S2 Standard 24 an understated look for players who prefer a stripped-down approach to their music. The original PRS Standard, introduced in 1987, evolved from Paul Smith’s pre-factory all-mahogany guitars. Reimagined here for the S2 Series, the Standard 24 is gig-ready with a price tag to match.

After ten years, the PRS S2 Series is being updated with USA-made pickup and electronics for 2024 (and beyond). We are proud to bring this added value to what has become a fully integrated part of our manufacturing line and product offering.

# S2 Vela

# Vintage Personality. Modern Reliability.

Anchored by PRS playability and craftsmanship, the S2 Vela is perfect for players who want PRS build quality and reliability with a fresh aesthetic. The Vela is the maiden voyage into an offset body shape for PRS and is both elegant and edgy. Loaded with a PRS DS-01 humbucker in the treble pickup position and the PRS Narrowfield in the bass pickup position, the Vela has a bright, punchy tone that sounds great plugged into your pedalboard or straight into an amp. A coil-tap on the tone control allows the DS-01 pickup to split into singlecoils and explore a whole new range of tones. The PRS plate-style bridge holds two brass saddles specifically designed for great sustain and perfect intonation so both rhythm and lead tones sound great no matter where you are on the fretboard. In the studio or on the stage, you won’t want to leave this guitar at home.

After ten years, the PRS S2 Series is being updated with USA-made pickup and electronics for 2024 (and beyond). We are proud to bring this added value to what has become a fully integrated part of our manufacturing line and product offering.

## Featured Specifications

### Plate-Style Bridge

Our steel plate-style bridge is easy to string, comfortable, fully-intonating and it sounds great.

### Low-Mass Locking Tuners

Our lightweight, locking tuners make stringing a snap and keep your guitar in tune.

## Accolades

"If you’ve previously balked at trying a PRS because you’d didn’t dig the styling, this beautiful machine—and its beautiful tones—might flip that notion on its head.”

- Premier Guitar

"If the Vela had been made in the 1950's, it would be considered as classic as the Stratocaster. It's a natural guitar with a wonderful personality!”

- Walker Teret, Lower Dens

“PRS guitars are made with love and you can feel it when you play them. They are also made with an incredible understanding of what makes a guitar great. The Vela is a great rock guitar. It can do scuzz, fuzz, psych, punk, whatever you want and it also can scream some insane leads. I can’t get enough of this axe!”

- Michael Gibbons, Bardo Pond

“The Vela nails all of the vintage tones I've become accustomed to using in the studio, and has become my go to live because of its stable intonation, tuning, and playability.”

- Thomas Onebane, Royal Teeth

“I think the PRS team has hit a home run with the Vela. In terms of quality and tone at this price point, I don’t think anyone else is making anything remotely close.”

- Jordan Smith, Diarrhea Planet

“Overall, the PRS S2 Vela is a great guitar at a great price point. This is the perfect jack-of-all-trades guitar and is one that will presumably last for many years to come.”

- Crafted

"PRS have really created something important with the S2 range. Every guitar I’ve played has shown the thought, care and (yes) love that the company has thrown at the project. But the Vela may be the best yet. It is beautifully made, has a huge tonal range and sounds and feels lovely.”

- Guitar In Your Pocket

“This is SWEET. The feel and sound transcend what a guitar can be. The Vela has soul, it’s alive and part of something greater than you can imagine. It sounds so nice and is so beautiful. The Paul Reed Smith Vela, It’s a dream.”

- John Gibbons, Bardo Pond

“I've always been a bridge pickup guy and a sucker for big, bright, punchy guitar tones. I knew this guitar would be great for clean studio playing, but I was really pleasantly surprised by how well the Starla pickup worked for driving power-pop and punky, angular playing -- The tone is bright and punchy, but never too thin. The coil tap control is a neat function too, opening up an equally great tone with a little more chime to it. I can tell I'll be using this guitar for years to come in a variety of different projects.”

- Tommy Siegel, Jukebox The Ghost

A really broad range of sounds can be had from this guitar using the tone control, the three-way toggle selector and the coil split, especially if one were to run it through a larger amp with some tonal options and a pedal or two.”

- American Songwriter

“While it’s probably shocking to the PRS purists, I’m a sucker for offset guitars and the Vela design won me over instantly.”

- Tone Report

“With its versatile variety of tones, first-class craftsmanship and construction, and incredibly comfortable playability, the PRS S2 Vela is a new classic that will be embraced by discriminating players looking for something a little different.”

# S2 Vela Satin

# Simply Irresistible

The S2 Vela Satin is a vintage-inspired guitar with loads of personality and tonal textures. The Vela boasts a contemporary offset body shape, and the addition of a satin nitro finish provides added attitude and resonance and a truly addictive feel.

Its pickguard-loaded electronics feature a PRS DS-01 pickup in the treble pickup position, providing a bright, punky tone, while the PRS Narrowfield in the bass pickup position gives the Vela some noteworthy bite. The coil-tap on the tone control allows the treble pickup to split to single coils, providing a balanced tone that will cut through the mix with style. Anchoring this guitar is the PRS plate-style bridge with two saddles that were designed to compensate for intonation. This bridge harkens back to Paul’s early designs and traditional bass plate-style bridges but is top-loading for easy restringing. Like the bridge found on Paul’s Guitar and some Private Stock models, PRS’s plate-style bridge features brass saddles and a steel plate for maximum tonal sustain.

After ten years, the PRS S2 Series is being updated with USA-made pickup and electronics for 2024 (and beyond). We are proud to bring this added value to what has become a fully integrated part of our manufacturing line and product offering.

The S2 Vela Semi-Hollow is a vintage-inspired guitar with loads of personality and tonal textures. Its offset body shape is at once elegant and edgy, and the addition of a semi-hollow body and f-hole gives the Vela added attitude and resonance.

The S2 Vela Semi-Hollow Satin is a vintage-inspired guitar with loads of personality and tonal textures. The Vela boasts a contemporary offset body shape, and the addition of a semi-hollow body and satin nitro finish gives the Vela added attitude and resonance with a truly addictive feel.

Its pickguard-loaded electronics feature a PRS DS-01 pickup in the treble pickup position, providing a bright, punky tone, while the PRS Narrowfield in the bass pickup position gives the Vela some noteworthy bite. The coil-tap on the tone control allows the treble pickup to split to single coils, providing a balanced tone that will cut through the mix with style. Anchoring this guitar is the PRS plate-style bridge with two saddles that were designed to compensate for intonation. This bridge harkens back to Paul’s early designs and traditional bass plate-style bridges but is top-loading for easy restringing. Like the bridge found on Paul’s Guitar and some Private Stock models, PRS’s plate-style bridge features brass saddles and a steel plate for maximum tonal sustain.

After ten years, the PRS S2 Series is being updated with USA-made pickup and electronics for 2024 (and beyond). We are proud to bring this added value to what has become a fully integrated part of our manufacturing line and product offering.

## Featured Specifications

### Plate-Style Bridge

Our steel plate-style bridge is easy to string, comfortable, fully-intonating and it sounds great.

### Low-Mass Locking Tuners

Our lightweight, locking tuners make stringing a snap and keep your guitar in tune.

### PRS DS-01 & Narrowfield

A lively pickup combination that provides full midrange and articulate, chimey high-end.

# SE 277

# Texture and Versatility

Built with a longer 27.7” scale length, the SE 277 is perfect for heavier, more aggressive guitar playing. But this is no one-trick pony. The 277’s 85/15 “S” pickups were designed to deliver remarkable clarity and extended high and low end, allowing the 277 to handle blues and funk with flair as well. Additional appointments include a string-through bridge design for strong, resonant tone.

Whether you’re interested in rocking a clean tone, picking bass lines beneath higher melodies on one guitar, or chugging out the heaviest drop-tuned riffs, the SE 277 offers versatility in a reliable package for players looking to push the envelope. Ships tuned B to B.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Plate Style (String Through)

Designed with individual saddles for perfect intonation and string-through design for increased resonance and sustain.

### PRS-Designed Tuners

Designed to PRS's specifications, these lightweight tuners provide precise tuning and won't dampen your tone.

### PRS 85/15 “S”

Uncovered pickups designed to PRS’s specifications with clarity and extended high and low end – perfect for modern applications.

## Accolades

"Try as I might, I couldn’t find a dang thing wrong or even slightly unsatisfying with the PRS SE 277. It’s comfortable, fun, and easy to play; has a wide range of versatile, simple-to-control tones; and proved a gleeful partner in sonic mayhem as well as a suave traditionalist.”

- Premier Guitar

"Not just for metalheads, this affordable baritone from PRS is far from a one-trick pony.”

- Guitar-Bass.net

“I love how this guitar is great at heavy and aggressive music but can play pretty much any style of music you want to play on it. This may be the most versatile of all the guitars in this review.”

# SE CE 24

# Addictive Bolt-on Feel

The SE CE 24 pairs the traditional PRS Custom 24 combination of a maple top, mahogany back, and rosewood fretboard with a bolt-on maple neck. The added snap and response of bolt-on construction has been an essential part of guitar history from the beginning, and the CE’s voice and appointments carry that tradition forward with PRS’s unique spin on a classic. The 85/15 “S” pickups provide extended high and low end with clarity and balance, while the push/pull tone control adds the versatility of coil taps. The PRS SE CE 24 delivers tone, playability, and classic PRS looks that players of all styles can rock.

The PRS CE was originally introduced in 1988 and joins the SE Series for the first time for 2024.

“As long time CE players, we can say the new SE CE 24 gives you the amazing playability and feel of a classic PRS neck with the stability and quality needed to handle the grueling conditions of international touring. With a light weight body and a distinctly dynamic tone, it’s a phenomenal guitar for the road, the studio or the bedroom. It will be in our vaults for years to come.”

# SE CE 24 Standard Satin

# Professional Quality with a Popular Price Tag

Originally introduced in 1988, the CE has become an essential part of the PRS line-up, offering the snap and response of bolt-on construction. The SE CE 24 Standard Satin is the most affordable CE yet, pairing an all-mahogany body with a bolt-on maple neck. The mahogany body features a thin satin finish that results in a highly resonant instrument, and the maple neck’s semi-gloss finish provides a smooth playing feel. The PRS 85/15 “S” pickups provide extended high and low end with clarity and balance, while the push/pull tone control adds the versatility of coil taps.

This workhorse instrument delivers looks, tone, and playability, and is a great option for beginning players through professional musicians thanks to its high-quality build and popular price tag.

## Accolades

These [SE Custom 24 & SE Custom 24-08] are inherently versatile designs that will cover a wide range of styles. The vintage-hot voice of their pickups is a great place to start, but once you factor in those switching options these both reveal themselves as Swiss Army Knife six-strings.

# SE Custom 24-08

# Expanded Sonic Territory

The Custom 24 is the quintessential PRS guitar: the iconic guitar that started it all back in 1985. The Custom 24-08 keeps all the foundational specs of the instrument, while taking the Custom platform to new sonic territories. Like the Core Series instrument, the SE Custom 24-08 features two mini-toggle coil-tap switches that individually tap the humbuckers for single coil sounds and a total of eight pickup configurations.

Classic design elements include a maple top, mahogany back, rosewood fretboard, 24 frets, 25” scale length, bird inlays, signature headstock logo, and PRS patented molded tremolo.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo

Patented design, delivering tonal fidelity, player comfort, and tuning stability.

### PRS-Designed Tuners

Designed to PRS's specifications, these lightweight tuners provide precise tuning and won't dampen your tone.

### PRS TCI “S”

Musical pickups that offer versatile tones from spanky single coils to full soapbars. Designed to PRS’s specification.

## Accolades

For a sub-$1000 price point, you really get your money's worth when it comes to action, fit, & finish. This guitar, especially in the Eriza Verde finish, is stunning from top to bottom…I'd be hard-pressed to pick anything over this if you told me I need to grab a guitar and play a handful of styles and genres on stage tonight. PRS has done a great job with this one, and the SE Custom 24-08 is another premium addition to their affordable lines.

- UltimateGuitar.com

These [SE Custom 24 & SE Custom 24-08] are inherently versatile designs that will cover a wide range of styles. The vintage-hot voice of their pickups is a great place to start, but once you factor in those switching options these both reveal themselves as Swiss Army Knife six-strings.

- Music Radar

“Many times, when multiple options are available with pickups, one or two just don’t really make sense. Not here; we found the single coil tones very sweet and still maintained unity gain and didn’t require any fussing with boosting the signal in other ways to still be heard or cut through…Overall, it’s a practical and giggable instrument right out of the box.”

# SE DGT

# Meticulously Vintage

“I didn’t just rubber stamp this. This guitar is something I have been very involved in and am really proud of. The SE Series is lightyears ahead of anything I could get my hands on when I started playing - it’s amazing how far the quality has come – and I am proud to be able to offer this guitar to more people.” - David Grissom

The PRS SE DGT (David Grissom Trem) brings David Grissom’s signature model to the SE Series for the first time. Based on the McCarty platform, the DGT model has been a constant favorite since its introduction in 2007, thanks to Grissom’s deep knowledge of vintage guitars and his painstaking attention to detail. Every feature on the SE DGT has been considered from the neck shape to the fret choice and dressing, from the colors to the pickups and electronics layout.

The SE DGT features vintage-voiced humbuckers paired with individual volume controls for each pickup and a push/pull master tone control that taps the humbuckers for sweet, single-coil inspired sounds. This layout puts a lot of control and versatility on tap so you can focus on playing and not the guitar. Additional appointments include a maple top, mahogany back, 22-fret, 25” scale length mahogany neck with rosewood fretboard, and bird or moon inlays (inlays are color dependent).

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo

Patented design, delivering tonal fidelity, player comfort, and tuning stability.

### PRS-Designed Tuners

Designed to PRS's specifications, these lightweight tuners provide precise tuning and won't dampen your tone.

### PRS DGT “S”

Beautiful rhythm and solo tone with a Texas voice. Designed to PRS’s specifications.

## Accolades

These are beautiful guitars that play great and would make a perfect addition to anyone's arsenal who is looking to get that great PRS sound and craftsmanship at a lower price point. Can't beat a PRS gold top!"

# SE Hollowbody II Piezo

# Acoustic and Electric Tones In One

The SE Hollowbody II Piezo combines the balanced, clear, resonant tone of a hollowbody instrument with the power and stability of a solid-body electric guitar. Constructed with a maple back and top with mahogany sides, the SE Hollowbody II Piezo offers a light shimmer and snap in an attractive package. The 58/15 LT “S” pickups deliver clarity and balance that sound big and musical in a hollowbody platform.

Boasting an LR Baggs/PRS Piezo system, the SE Hollowbody II Piezo provides musicians with the versatility of wielding both acoustic and electric tones in one instrument. The instrument is designed with two discrete volume controls (magnetics and piezo) and output jacks (mix/piezo and magnetics). Players can plug into the “Mix/Piezo” jack and use the individual volume controls to blend the 58/15 LT “S” pickups with the piezo’s acoustic tones. Alternatively, players can plug into the jacks separately, so the guitar can run magnetic pickups into an amp and run the piezo through an acoustic amp or DI into the soundboard. When using the magnetic output jack in isolation, the piezo battery is bypassed completely, acting as a failsafe (in this scenario, the magnetic pickups still work even if the piezo battery has run out of juice).

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Adjustable 'Piezo' Stoptail

Including six individual piezo-equipped saddles, this bridge works with the LR Baggs/PRS proprietary piezo electronics, to effortlessly achieve electric and acoustic sounds in one instrument.

### PRS-Designed Tuners

Designed to PRS's specifications, these lightweight tuners provide precise tuning and won't dampen your tone.

### PRS 58/15 LT “S”

“Low turn” pickups with vintage warmth and welcome clarity, designed to PRS’s specifications.

# SE Hollowbody Standard Piezo

# Warmth and Resonance

The SE Hollowbody Standard Piezo features an all-mahogany body with hollow construction for a warm, resonant tone. Boasting 58/15 LT “S” pickups and an LR Baggs/PRS Piezo system, the SE Hollowbody Standard Piezo provides musicians with the versatility of wielding both acoustic and electric tones in one instrument. Additional appointments include a 22-fret wide fat neck, bone nut, and PRS adjustable Piezo stoptail bridge.

The instrument is designed with two discrete volume controls (magnetics and piezo) and output jacks (magnetics and mix/piezo). Players can plug into the “Mix/Piezo” jack and use the individual volume controls to blend the 58/15 “S” pickups with the piezo’s acoustic tones. Alternatively, players can plug into the jacks separately, so the guitar can run magnetic pickups into an amp and run the piezo through an acoustic amp or DI into the soundboard. When using the magnetic output jack in isolation, the piezo battery is bypassed completely, acting as a failsafe (in this scenario, the magnetic pickups still work even if the piezo battery has run out of juice).

The SE Hollowbody Standard Piezo is one guitar that can cover any gig in style.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Adjustable 'Piezo' Stoptail

Including six individual piezo-equipped saddles, this bridge works with the LR Baggs/PRS proprietary piezo electronics, to effortlessly achieve electric and acoustic sounds in one instrument.

### PRS-Designed Tuners

Designed to PRS's specifications, these lightweight tuners provide precise tuning and won't dampen your tone.

### PRS 58/15 LT “S”

“Low turn” pickups with vintage warmth and welcome clarity, designed to PRS’s specifications.

# SE Mark Holcomb

# Mercilessly Addictive

The band Periphery has become a force to be reckoned with in the progressive metal scene thanks to their complex rhythms and soaring melodies. Guitarist Mark Holcomb helps achieve this full, lethal sound with his PRS guitars and signature Seymour Duncan Scarlet and Scourge pickups. PRS and Holcomb have worked closely together to develop a truly unique guitar for the SE Series lineup.

"With my SE signature model, we managed to capture all of the defining characteristics of my Maryland-made guitar and turn it into a streamlined, less-costly package. It is an incredibly special instrument, and one that is now the primary focus of my rig in the studio and onstage." - Mark Holcomb, Periphery

The SE Mark Holcomb model truly stands on its own in the PRS lineup and delivers addictive playability thanks to some unique specifications, including a 24-fret, 25.5” scale length wide thin satin maple neck with 20” radius ebony fretboard. Holcomb’s signature pickups provide the right amount of output and articulation whether you’re playing sophisticated chords or solos and whether you’re playing alone or working in the mix of a band. Other specifications include a quilted maple veneer, black chrome hardware, and a 3-way blade pickup switch with push/pull tone knob for coil tapping.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Plate Style (String Through)

Designed with individual saddles for perfect intonation and string-through design for increased resonance and sustain.

### PRS-Designed Tuners

Designed to PRS's specifications, these lightweight tuners provide precise tuning and won't dampen your tone.

### Mark Holcomb Signature Seymour Duncan “Scarlet” & “Scourge”

The right amount of output to deliver aggression with clarity and articulation.

## Accolades

"This PRS SE is super playable, sleek, and has monstrous tone...we think this is one of the most exciting guitars so far this year! At the price, we also think it’s a fabulous value for the money.”

- Guitar Interactive

"The spec on offer here represents a high quality and, dare we say it, ‘posh’ metal guitar with a little bit extra under the hood thanks to the split-coil tones.”

# SE Mark Holcomb SVN

# Aggressive Clarity

The SE Mark Holcomb SVN model truly stands on its own in the PRS lineup and delivers addictive playability thanks to some unique specifications, including a 24-fret, 26.5” scale length, wide thin satin maple neck with 20” radius ebony fretboard. Holcomb’s signature Seymour Duncan Scarlet and Scourge 7-string pickups provide the right amount of output and articulation whether you’re playing sophisticated chords or solos and whether you’re playing alone or working in the mix of a band. Other specifications include black hardware, a 3-way blade pickup switch with push/pull tone knob for coil tapping, and a quilted maple veneer. The model is topped off with a string-through, plate-style, 7-string bridge.

“My SE SVN has become the perfect counterpart to my SE six-string, and an absolute mainstay in Periphery’s live rig. It’s designed to be aggressive, but its core features allow it to be diverse enough to handle clean and mid-gain tones just as effectively. If you’ve played my SE six, you’ll find that this builds off what we established with that guitar and more.” - Mark Holcomb, Periphery

# SE Mark Tremonti

# Ready To Rock

The SE Mark Tremonti provides a powerful voice and classic PRS aesthetic for players ready to rock. Through his solo work and as the lead guitarist of Alter Bridge and Creed, Tremonti has made a name for himself as a heavy rock player with melodic strength.

Additional appointments include a shallow violin carve with flame maple veneer, wide thin maple neck, and a trem-up route, making the SE Mark Tremonti fast to play and hard to put down.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo with Trem-Up Route

Patented design, delivering comfort and tuning stability, routed for massive dive-bombs and pitch bending.

# SE NF3

# Versatile Workhorse

The PRS SE NF3 is a distinct guitar in the PRS lineup. The heart of this guitar is a trio of PRS Narrowfield pickups, a first for the SE Series. Supporting these pickups is a poplar body, 22-fret bolt-on maple neck, and a rosewood fretboard. The SE NF3 is a versatile workhorse guitar that is fun to play and hard to put down. The Narrowfield DD (Deep Dish) “S” pickups are made with taller bobbins to fit more winds and extra metal pieces in between the magnets for a more focused, powerful tone. Anchored with PRS’s patented tremolo, this guitar can bend and flutter with ease.

Perfect for rock, blues, gospel, country, or jazz the PRS SE NF3 can punch, cry, lay down, or sing – as you like it.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo

Patented design, delivering tonal fidelity, player comfort, and tuning stability.

### PRS-Designed Tuners

Designed to PRS's specifications, these lightweight tuners provide precise tuning and won't dampen your tone.

### Narrowfield DD "S" Pickups

“Deep Dish” pickups made to PRS’s specifications with a mixed magnet/steel pole piece layout – delivering musical highs without losing bass and becoming anemic.

## Accolades

"I have always loved the PRS NF3. There was a long period where I couldn’t put it down! PRS has now introduced the SE NF3 and I was fortunate enough to get my hands on one… it’s a wonderful guitar! The pickups are really great and have a unique voice… its hard to believe PRS can make such a great guitar at this price point. I would highly recommend this guitar to anyone who wants a beefed up strat style guitar with a slightly slinkier feel."

# SE Paul's Guitar

# Paul’s Favorite Features In Your Hands

“The SE Paul’s Guitar is a great example of design, engineering, and teamwork. It’s as close to home as we could get inside of the SE Series, and I am very proud of it,” - Paul Reed Smith

The SE Paul’s Guitar delivers a lot of “PRS,” starting with tone and versatility. The TCI “S” treble and bass pickups deliver a pure, vintage sound. The SE Paul’s Guitar also features two mini-toggle switches between the volume and tone knobs, which enable you to coil tap both pickups independently, yielding eight total pickup combinations. The PRS stoptail bridge is the same machined stoptail with brass inserts as spec'd on the Core Paul's Guitar.

“The Paul’s Guitar, like the Modern Eagle before it, has always been about Paul’s latest discoveries in guitar making. To bring this guitar into the SE Series, we knew the tone, functionality, and playability had to be right and had to be consistent,” said Jack Higginbotham, COO, PRS Guitars. “We feel this guitar offers a lot of value to players.”

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Stoptail with Brass Inserts

Engineered with curved string slots with brass inserts and brass studs to take full advantage of the resonant properties of the guitar.

### Vintage-Style Tuners

Traditional closed-back tuners engineered to promote resonance.

### PRS TCI “S”

Musical pickups that offer versatile tones from spanky single coils to full soapbars. Designed to PRS’s specification.

## Accolades

“The import version of Paul’s Guitar delivers a big dollop of the sort of looks you get from a high-end PRS, and the sound and playability make it feel much more expensive than it is.”

- Premier Guitar

“Aside from the effortless playability, intonation, tuning stability and old-world resonance (all foundations of the PRS empire), the single-coil voices from these new TCI pickups raise the bar, while the humbucking side seems to pack musical heat, clarity and considerable versatility in equal measure.”

# SE Santana

# Legendary Tone

Carlos Santana’s influence as a PRS artist led to the development of our SE electric guitar series, which launched in 2001. In honor of that legacy, PRS is proud to offer the SE Santana model. The SE Santana features a 24.5” scale length on a 24 fret neck, the PRS patented molded tremolo, Santana "S" humbuckers, and the same Santana body shape silhouette as Santana’s revered American-made PRS models. We believe this guitar and its appointments honor Santana’s skill and style better than ever and offer players great quality and value. Be sure to try an SE Santana at an authorized dealer near you.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo

Patented design, delivering tonal fidelity, player comfort, and tuning stability.

### PRS-Designed Tuners

Designed to PRS's specifications, these lightweight tuners provide precise tuning and won't dampen your tone.

### PRS Santana “S”

Warm, smooth tone that can bite when you dig in.

# SE Silver Sky Maple

# Reach For The Sky

The SE Silver Sky Maple is a familiar iteration of the original Silver Sky model that was first introduced with John Mayer in 2018. This workhorse guitar provides ample tone and playability in three distinct colors, delivering looks, feel, and sound. The PRS SE Silver Sky Maple starts with a poplar body, bolt-on maple neck, and maple fretboard with PRS trademark bird inlays. The 22-fret, 25.5” scale length neck features the original 635JM carve and an 8.5” fretboard radius, so the PRS SE Silver Sky will feel right at home. Plug it in, and the three single-coil 635JM “S” pickups will bark and sing. This guitar is anchored by a two-point steel tremolo, synthetic bone nut, and vintage-style tuners. Other design features include the PRS Silver Sky inverted headstock shape and the PRS double-acting truss rod (accessible from the front of the headstock for ease of use). Ships with PRS Classic 10-46 strings and gig bag.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS 2-Point Steel Tremolo

Comfortable tremolo functionality with exceptional tuning stability, featuring a classic 2-point mounting system.

### Vintage-Style Tuners

Traditional closed-back tuners engineered to promote resonance.

### PRS 635JM “S”

Full, warm vintage-inspired single coils with a musical high-end that is never “ice-picky” or brash. Designed to PRS’s specification.

Its PRS TCI “S” pickups are paired with a 3-way toggle switch and two mini-toggle coil tap switches that individually tap the humbuckers into true single coils for a total of eight pickup configurations.

With sonic range and rock-solid reliability, the PRS SE Standard 24-08 will keep you playing without compromise.

# SE Swamp Ash Special

# Fresh Face and Versatile Voice

The PRS SE Swamp Ash Special is a unique offering in the growing PRS SE Series. With a swamp ash body and 22-fret maple neck with maple fretboard, the SE Swamp Ash Special is a fresh face and versatile voice.

The 85/15 “S” pickups flank a PRS-Designed AS-01 Single Coil “S” pickup in the middle position. The AS-01 Single Coil features both alnico and steel (hence the name), which adds mass to the pickups helping to create a powerful sound. Paired with a push-pull tone control and 3-way pickup switch, this pickup/electronics package gives players an array of sounds to enjoy, and the addition of PRS’s patented tremolo adds a touch more versatility. The overall tone of the PRS SE Swamp Ash Special offers tight lowend, bright but mellow high-end, and a welcome twangy tone that can reach “hot country,” blues, and even jazz territory.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo

Patented design, delivering tonal fidelity, player comfort, and tuning stability.

### PRS-Designed Tuners

Designed to PRS's specifications, these lightweight tuners provide precise tuning and won't dampen your tone.

### 85/15 "S" & AS-01 Pickups

Three pickup layout with unique switching for an array of sounds that can cover “hot country” to blues and jazz.

## Accolades

"I’m so impressed by the variety and range of tones you can get out of this guitar. The humbucker sound is so rich and warm and when you split to single coil the volume stays balanced without losing presence. I love the custom finish which gives a lot of style and finesse to this model, the neck is resonant, and its shape makes it very easy and comfortable to play.”

# SE Zach Myers

# Unbelievable Feel and Price

The SE Zach Myers is packed with features that will satisfy even the most demanding musicians. Featuring a chambered mahogany body with maple cap, flame maple veneer, and single f-hole, the SE Zach Myers provides smooth mid-range tones with a natural, resonant internal reverb. The resonance of the semi-hollow body paired with the smooth feel of the satin finish neck will make an immediate impression in your hands. Additional appointments to the SE Zach Myers signature model include a 22-fret, 24.594” scale length neck, PRS adjustable stoptail bridge, vintage-style tuners, and PRS-designed 245 “S” pickups paired with two volume and two tone controls and a 3-way toggle pickup switch. These pickups bring high-end clarity, low-end power, and an overall aggressive punch that maintains a certain sweetness.

Zach Myers, lead guitarist of the multi-platinum rock band Shinedown, picked up a PRS Custom 22 at the age of fifteen and announced his first SE signature model in 2010. As a guitarist who has rocked PRS on stage and teched for several PRS bands, Myers has an intimate understanding of how a guitar should feel and what the build quality should be. Those details have again created an eye-popping player’s guitar that can take a beating.

“When I was younger, I always wanted a “Private Stock” guitar, but I couldn’t afford one. When I told Paul the SE Zach Myers reminded me of that, he laughed, but also slightly agreed. The goal of the PRS SE Zach Myers has always been to make a guitar that stood out in the long line of amazing, affordable guitars that is the SE Series. The appointments we selected for this guitar, I feel, make it one of the best guitars you buy on the market right now – no matter the price point…even though this guitar is priced for everyone to afford. I hope players of all styles and levels enjoy it.” – Zach Myers

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Adjustable Stoptail

Stoptail bridge design with individually adjustable saddles for ease of intonation.

### Vintage-Style Tuners

Traditional closed-back tuners engineered to promote resonance.

### PRS 245 “S” Pickups

High-end clarity, smooth midrange tones, and low-end power that combine to provide a sweet but aggressive punch.

## Accolades

"The PRS SE Zach Myers is a well-realized and well-built instrument that, quite honestly, can stand toe-to-toe with semi-hollows that cost four times its price. But beyond its obvious hard-rock pedigree, it’s a very versatile instrument that can handle most any genre of music. In fact, the SE Zach Myers is a top-notch axe capable of so much that it almost seems criminally underpriced."

# SE Custom 24

# Professional Quality. Classic PRS Design.

The SE Custom 24 brings the original PRS design platform to the high-quality, more affordable SE Series of instruments. Played by internationally touring artists, gigging musicians, and aspiring players, the SE Custom 24 is a modern classic with roadworthy durability, addictive playability, and wide array of tones.

Featuring a maple top, mahogany back, wide thin maple neck, rosewood fretboard with bird inlays, and the PRS patented tremolo, the PRS SE Custom 24 boasts many familiar appointments. Its versatile sounds come from the 85/15 “S” pickups paired with a volume, push/pull tone control, and 3-way blade pickup selector. Now with ergonomic lampshade knobs and PRS's flat-grip switch tip design, the PRS SE Custom 24 is more performance-ready than ever.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo

### PRS-Designed Tuners

Designed to PRS's specifications, these lightweight tuners provide precise tuning and won't dampen your tone.

## Accolades

These [SE Custom 24 & SE Custom 24-08] are inherently versatile designs that will cover a wide range of styles. The vintage-hot voice of their pickups is a great place to start, but once you factor in those switching options these both reveal themselves as Swiss Army Knife six-strings.

Featuring a maple top, mahogany back, wide thin maple neck, rosewood fretboard with bird inlays, and the PRS patented tremolo, the PRS SE Custom 24 boasts many familiar appointments. Its versatile sounds come from the 85/15 “S” pickups paired with a volume, push/pull tone control, and 3-way blade pickup selector. Now with ergonomic lampshade knobs and PRS's flat-grip switch tip design, the PRS SE Custom 24 is more performance-ready than ever.

## Accolades

These [SE Custom 24 & SE Custom 24-08] are inherently versatile designs that will cover a wide range of styles. The vintage-hot voice of their pickups is a great place to start, but once you factor in those switching options these both reveal themselves as Swiss Army Knife six-strings.

# SE Custom 24-08

# Expanded Sonic Territory

The Custom 24 is the quintessential PRS guitar: the iconic guitar that started it all back in 1985. The Custom 24-08 keeps all the foundational specs of the instrument, while taking the Custom platform to new sonic territories. Like the Core Series instrument, the SE Custom 24-08 features two mini-toggle coil-tap switches that individually tap the humbuckers for single coil sounds and a total of eight pickup configurations.

Classic design elements include a maple top, mahogany back, rosewood fretboard, 24 frets, 25” scale length, bird inlays, signature headstock logo, and PRS patented tremolo.

### PRS-Designed Tuners

Designed to PRS's specifications, these lightweight tuners provide precise tuning and won't dampen your tone.

### PRS TCI “S”

Musical pickups that offer versatile tones from spanky single coils to full soapbars. Designed to PRS’s specification.

## Accolades

For a sub-$1000 price point, you really get your money's worth when it comes to action, fit, & finish. This guitar, especially in the Eriza Verde finish, is stunning from top to bottom…I'd be hard-pressed to pick anything over this if you told me I need to grab a guitar and play a handful of styles and genres on stage tonight. PRS has done a great job with this one, and the SE Custom 24-08 is another premium addition to their affordable lines.

- UltimateGuitar.com

These [SE Custom 24 & SE Custom 24-08] are inherently versatile designs that will cover a wide range of styles. The vintage-hot voice of their pickups is a great place to start, but once you factor in those switching options these both reveal themselves as Swiss Army Knife six-strings.

- Music Radar

“Many times, when multiple options are available with pickups, one or two just don’t really make sense. Not here; we found the single coil tones very sweet and still maintained unity gain and didn’t require any fussing with boosting the signal in other ways to still be heard or cut through…Overall, it’s a practical and giggable instrument right out of the box.”

# SE Custom 24-08

# Expanded Sonic Territory

The Custom 24 is the quintessential PRS guitar: the iconic guitar that started it all back in 1985. The Custom 24-08 keeps all the foundational specs of the instrument, while taking the Custom platform to new sonic territories. Like the Core Series instrument, the SE Custom 24-08 features two mini-toggle coil-tap switches that individually tap the humbuckers for single coil sounds and a total of eight pickup configurations.

Classic design elements include a maple top, mahogany back, rosewood fretboard, 24 frets, 25” scale length, bird inlays, signature headstock logo, and PRS patented tremolo.

## Accolades

For a sub-$1000 price point, you really get your money's worth when it comes to action, fit, & finish. This guitar, especially in the Eriza Verde finish, is stunning from top to bottom…I'd be hard-pressed to pick anything over this if you told me I need to grab a guitar and play a handful of styles and genres on stage tonight. PRS has done a great job with this one, and the SE Custom 24-08 is another premium addition to their affordable lines.

- UltimateGuitar.com

These [SE Custom 24 & SE Custom 24-08] are inherently versatile designs that will cover a wide range of styles. The vintage-hot voice of their pickups is a great place to start, but once you factor in those switching options these both reveal themselves as Swiss Army Knife six-strings.

- Music Radar

“Many times, when multiple options are available with pickups, one or two just don’t really make sense. Not here; we found the single coil tones very sweet and still maintained unity gain and didn’t require any fussing with boosting the signal in other ways to still be heard or cut through…Overall, it’s a practical and giggable instrument right out of the box.”

# SE Custom 24 Semi-Hollow Piezo

# Electric and Acoustic Tones

The PRS SE Custom 24 Semi-Hollow Piezo is a highly sophisticated and incredibly versatile instrument. The Custom 24 is the original design first introduced by PRS in 1985 as a solidbody guitar with maple top, mahogany back, dual humbuckers, and the patented PRS tremolo. This semi-hollow version adds natural resonance and a vibrant, organic tone.

The humbuckers in this model are PRS 85/15 “S” pickups, which can be tapped via the push/pull tone control for more sounds. The addition of the LR Baggs/PRS Piezo system furthers the instrument’s versatility by offering electric and acoustic tones in one guitar. The PRS SE Custom 24 Semi-Hollow Piezo is designed with two discrete volume controls (magnetics and piezo) and output jacks (mix/piezo and magnetics). Players can plug into the “Mix/Piezo” jack and use the individual volume controls to blend the 85/15 “S” pickups with the piezo’s acoustic tones. Alternatively, players can plug into the jacks separately, so the guitar can run magnetic pickups into an amp and run the piezo through an acoustic amp or DI into the soundboard. When using the magnetic output jack in isolation, the piezo battery is bypassed completely, acting as a failsafe (in this scenario, the magnetic pickups still work even if the piezo battery has run out of juice).

Additional details include a matching headstock veneer, headstock and fretboard binding, and lampshade knobs. With nearly infinite tones and roadworthy reliability, the PRS SE Custom 24 Semi-Hollow Piezo is a modern classic that looks and feels as good as it sounds.

# SE Custom 24 Semi-Hollow Piezo

# Electric and Acoustic Tones

The PRS SE Custom 24 Semi-Hollow Piezo is a highly sophisticated and incredibly versatile instrument. The Custom 24 is the original design first introduced by PRS in 1985 as a solidbody guitar with maple top, mahogany back, dual humbuckers, and the patented PRS tremolo. This semi-hollow version adds natural resonance and a vibrant, organic tone.

The humbuckers in this model are PRS 85/15 “S” pickups, which can be tapped via the push/pull tone control for more sounds. The addition of the LR Baggs/PRS Piezo system furthers the instrument’s versatility by offering electric and acoustic tones in one guitar. The PRS SE Custom 24 Semi-Hollow Piezo is designed with two discrete volume controls (magnetics and piezo) and output jacks (mix/piezo and magnetics). Players can plug into the “Mix/Piezo” jack and use the individual volume controls to blend the 85/15 “S” pickups with the piezo’s acoustic tones. Alternatively, players can plug into the jacks separately, so the guitar can run magnetic pickups into an amp and run the piezo through an acoustic amp or DI into the soundboard. When using the magnetic output jack in isolation, the piezo battery is bypassed completely, acting as a failsafe (in this scenario, the magnetic pickups still work even if the piezo battery has run out of juice).

Additional details include a matching headstock veneer, headstock and fretboard binding, and lampshade knobs. With nearly infinite tones and roadworthy reliability, the PRS SE Custom 24 Semi-Hollow Piezo is a modern classic that looks and feels as good as it sounds.

# SE McCarty 594

# Vintage Inspired Versatility

The SE McCarty 594 is a versatile, vintage-inspired instrument that delivers both humbucking and single-coil tones in a reliable, roadworthy guitar. Thanks to its dual volume and push/pull tone controls, the SE McCarty 594 can seamlessly master humbucking and single coil sonic territories, so players can find all the tones they are looking for.

Its 58/15 LT “S” pickups were carefully designed to deliver warm, vintage-inspired tone with sweetness and clarity. The zinc two-piece bridge and vintage-style tuners anchor the SE McCarty 594 and stay true to its vintage promise, while the classic PRS body shape and bird inlays add a hint of modern style to this classic feature set. Other features include a bound 22-fret Pattern Vintage neck and slightly thicker back for sustain.

Designed to capture the heart of the McCarty family of instruments, the SE McCarty 594 is high-quality workhorse instrument.

# SE McCarty 594 Laurel Burl Limited Edition

# Vintage Vibe Meets Modern Precision

The PRS SE McCarty 594 is designed to capture the essence of vintage guitar tones while delivering modern reliability. Named after Ted McCarty, the legendary guitar pioneer who influenced Paul Reed Smith’s early designs, this model strikes a balance between classic character and contemporary playability. This limited edition features a striking laurel burl veneer, adding a unique look to this popular model.

At its core, the SE McCarty 594 features a mahogany body with a maple top, combining warmth and sustain with a touch of brightness. The Pattern Vintage mahogany neck provides a familiar yet refined feel, while the rosewood fingerboard, adorned with PRS bird inlays, offers smooth playability across all 22 frets. The 24.594” scale length—just slightly shorter than typical PRS models—contributes to its vintage feel, adding to the guitar’s natural warmth and character.

Equipped with PRS 58/15 LT “S” pickups, the SE McCarty 594 Laurel Burl Limited Edition delivers clarity and fullness in equal measure. These pickups are designed to evoke the tones of the iconic instruments from the ‘50s, with the ability to handle both clean and overdriven settings with ease. The push/pull tone controls further enhance the guitar’s versatility, allowing players to access both humbucking and single-coil tones in one instrument. With a two-piece bridge and vintage-style tuners, the SE McCarty 594 Laurel Burl Limited Edition offers solid intonation and tuning stability.

Only 500 of these instruments will be made for 2025.

# SE CE 24 Standard

# Professional Quality with a Popular Price Tag

Originally introduced in 1988, the CE has become an essential part of the PRS line-up, offering the snap and response of bolt-on construction. The SE CE 24 Standard is the most affordable CE yet, pairing an all-mahogany body with a bolt-on maple neck. The mahogany body features a thin satin finish that results in a highly resonant instrument, and the maple neck’s semi-gloss finish provides a smooth playing feel. The PRS 85/15 “S” pickups provide extended high and low end with clarity and balance, while the push/pull tone control adds the versatility of coil taps.

This workhorse instrument delivers looks, tone, and playability, and is a great option for beginning players through professional musicians thanks to its high-quality build and popular price tag.

# SE CE 24 Standard

# Professional Quality with a Popular Price Tag

Originally introduced in 1988, the CE has become an essential part of the PRS line-up, offering the snap and response of bolt-on construction. The SE CE 24 Standard is the most affordable CE yet, pairing an all-mahogany body with a bolt-on maple neck. The mahogany body features a thin satin finish that results in a highly resonant instrument, and the maple neck’s semi-gloss finish provides a smooth playing feel. The PRS 85/15 “S” pickups provide extended high and low end with clarity and balance, while the push/pull tone control adds the versatility of coil taps.

This workhorse instrument delivers looks, tone, and playability, and is a great option for beginning players through professional musicians thanks to its high-quality build and popular price tag.

# SE DGT Standard

# Understated Class

The PRS SE DGT Standard brings David Grissom’s signature model to a stripped-down, all-mahogany platform, delivering organic tone, rich resonance, and bold midrange presence. Built with a solid mahogany body and neck, the SE DGT Standard adds warmth and growl to the model’s signature clarity and articulation.

Like the SE DGT, the SE DGT Standard offers a versatile control layout with individual volume controls for each pickup, a master tone control with push/pull coil tapping, and a satisfyingly smooth and responsive PRS tremolo. Moon inlays and two timeless finishes—McCarty Tobacco Sunburst, and Vintage Cherry—give this guitar an understated elegance that’s ready for the stage or studio.

Whether you’re chasing vintage character, flexible tone, or modern reliability, the SE DGT Standard offers it all in a guitar designed to be played.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo

Patented design, delivering tonal fidelity, player comfort, and tuning stability.

### PRS-Designed Tuners

Designed to PRS's specifications, these lightweight tuners provide precise tuning and won't dampen your tone.

# SE DGT Standard

# Understated Class

The PRS SE DGT Standard brings David Grissom’s signature model to a stripped-down, all-mahogany platform, delivering organic tone, rich resonance, and bold midrange presence. Built with a solid mahogany body and neck, the SE DGT Standard adds warmth and growl to the model’s signature clarity and articulation.

Like the SE DGT, the SE DGT Standard offers a versatile control layout with individual volume controls for each pickup, a master tone control with push/pull coil tapping, and a satisfyingly smooth and responsive PRS tremolo. Moon inlays and two timeless finishes—McCarty Tobacco Sunburst, and Vintage Cherry—give this guitar an understated elegance that’s ready for the stage or studio.

Whether you’re chasing vintage character, flexible tone, or modern reliability, the SE DGT Standard offers it all in a guitar designed to be played.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo

Patented design, delivering tonal fidelity, player comfort, and tuning stability.

### PRS-Designed Tuners

Designed to PRS's specifications, these lightweight tuners provide precise tuning and won't dampen your tone.

### PRS DGT “S”

Beautiful rhythm and solo tone with a Texas voice. Designed to PRS’s specifications.

# SE Hollowbody Standard Piezo

# Warmth and Resonance

The SE Hollowbody Standard Piezo features an all-mahogany body with hollow construction for a warm, resonant tone. Boasting 58/15 LT “S” pickups and an LR Baggs/PRS Piezo system, the SE Hollowbody Standard Piezo provides musicians with the versatility of wielding both acoustic and electric tones in one instrument. Additional appointments include a 22-fret wide fat neck, bone nut, and PRS adjustable Piezo stoptail bridge.

The instrument is designed with two discrete volume controls (magnetics and piezo) and output jacks (magnetics and mix/piezo). Players can plug into the “Mix/Piezo” jack and use the individual volume controls to blend the 58/15 “S” pickups with the piezo’s acoustic tones. Alternatively, players can plug into the jacks separately, so the guitar can run magnetic pickups into an amp and run the piezo through an acoustic amp or DI into the soundboard. When using the magnetic output jack in isolation, the piezo battery is bypassed completely, acting as a failsafe (in this scenario, the magnetic pickups still work even if the piezo battery has run out of juice).

The SE Hollowbody Standard Piezo is one guitar that can cover any gig in style.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Adjustable 'Piezo' Stoptail

Including six individual piezo-equipped saddles, this bridge works with the LR Baggs/PRS proprietary piezo electronics, to effortlessly achieve electric and acoustic sounds in one instrument.

### PRS-Designed Tuners

Designed to PRS's specifications, these lightweight tuners provide precise tuning and won't dampen your tone.

### PRS 58/15 LT “S”

“Low turn” pickups with vintage warmth and welcome clarity, designed to PRS’s specifications.

# SE Hollowbody Standard Piezo

# Warmth and Resonance

The SE Hollowbody Standard Piezo features an all-mahogany body with hollow construction for a warm, resonant tone. Boasting 58/15 LT “S” pickups and an LR Baggs/PRS Piezo system, the SE Hollowbody Standard Piezo provides musicians with the versatility of wielding both acoustic and electric tones in one instrument. Additional appointments include a 22-fret wide fat neck, bone nut, and PRS adjustable Piezo stoptail bridge.

The instrument is designed with two discrete volume controls (magnetics and piezo) and output jacks (magnetics and mix/piezo). Players can plug into the “Mix/Piezo” jack and use the individual volume controls to blend the 58/15 “S” pickups with the piezo’s acoustic tones. Alternatively, players can plug into the jacks separately, so the guitar can run magnetic pickups into an amp and run the piezo through an acoustic amp or DI into the soundboard. When using the magnetic output jack in isolation, the piezo battery is bypassed completely, acting as a failsafe (in this scenario, the magnetic pickups still work even if the piezo battery has run out of juice).

The SE Hollowbody Standard Piezo is one guitar that can cover any gig in style.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Adjustable 'Piezo' Stoptail

Including six individual piezo-equipped saddles, this bridge works with the LR Baggs/PRS proprietary piezo electronics, to effortlessly achieve electric and acoustic sounds in one instrument.

### PRS-Designed Tuners

Designed to PRS's specifications, these lightweight tuners provide precise tuning and won't dampen your tone.

### PRS 58/15 LT “S”

“Low turn” pickups with vintage warmth and welcome clarity, designed to PRS’s specifications.

The SE Hollowbody II Piezo combines the balanced, clear, resonant tone of a hollowbody instrument with the power and stability of a solid-body electric guitar. Constructed with a maple back and top with mahogany sides, the SE Hollowbody II Piezo offers a light shimmer and snap in an attractive package. The 58/15 LT “S” pickups deliver clarity and balance that sound big and musical in a hollowbody platform.

Boasting an LR Baggs/PRS Piezo system, the SE Hollowbody II Piezo provides musicians with the versatility of wielding both acoustic and electric tones in one instrument. The instrument is designed with two discrete volume controls (magnetics and piezo) and output jacks (mix/piezo and magnetics). Players can plug into the “Mix/Piezo” jack and use the individual volume controls to blend the 58/15 LT “S” pickups with the piezo’s acoustic tones. Alternatively, players can plug into the jacks separately, so the guitar can run magnetic pickups into an amp and run the piezo through an acoustic amp or DI into the soundboard. When using the magnetic output jack in isolation, the piezo battery is bypassed completely, acting as a failsafe (in this scenario, the magnetic pickups still work even if the piezo battery has run out of juice).

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Adjustable 'Piezo' Stoptail

Including six individual piezo-equipped saddles, this bridge works with the LR Baggs/PRS proprietary piezo electronics, to effortlessly achieve electric and acoustic sounds in one instrument.

### PRS-Designed Tuners

Designed to PRS's specifications, these lightweight tuners provide precise tuning and won't dampen your tone.

### PRS 58/15 LT “S”

“Low turn” pickups with vintage warmth and welcome clarity, designed to PRS’s specifications.

# SE NF3

# Versatile Workhorse

The PRS SE NF3 is a distinct guitar in the PRS lineup. The heart of this guitar is a trio of PRS Narrowfield pickups, a first for the SE Series. Supporting these pickups is a poplar body, 22-fret bolt-on maple neck, and a rosewood fretboard. The SE NF3 is a versatile workhorse guitar that is fun to play and hard to put down. The Narrowfield DD (Deep Dish) “S” pickups are made with taller bobbins to fit more winds and extra metal pieces in between the magnets for a more focused, powerful tone. Anchored with PRS’s patented tremolo, this guitar can bend and flutter with ease.

Perfect for rock, blues, gospel, country, or jazz the PRS SE NF3 can punch, cry, lay down, or sing – as you like it.

This model is also available with a maple fretboard. To explore that offering, please click here.

### PRS-Designed Tuners

## Accolades

"I have always loved the PRS NF3. There was a long period where I couldn’t put it down! PRS has now introduced the SE NF3 and I was fortunate enough to get my hands on one… it’s a wonderful guitar! The pickups are really great and have a unique voice… its hard to believe PRS can make such a great guitar at this price point. I would highly recommend this guitar to anyone who wants a beefed up strat style guitar with a slightly slinkier feel."

# SE NF3 Maple

# Versatile Workhorse

The PRS SE NF3 is a distinct guitar in the PRS lineup. The heart of this guitar is a trio of PRS Narrowfield pickups, a first for the SE Series. Supporting these pickups is a poplar body, 22-fret bolt-on maple neck, and a maple fretboard. The SE NF3 is a versatile workhorse guitar that is fun to play and hard to put down. The Narrowfield DD (Deep Dish) “S” pickups are made with taller bobbins to fit more winds and extra metal pieces in between the magnets for a more focused, powerful tone. Anchored with PRS’s patented tremolo, this guitar can bend and flutter with ease.

Perfect for rock, blues, gospel, country, or jazz the PRS SE NF3 can punch, cry, lay down, or sing – as you like it.

This model is also available with a rosewood fretboard. To explore that offering, please click here.

## Accolades

"I have always loved the PRS NF3. There was a long period where I couldn’t put it down! PRS has now introduced the SE NF3 and I was fortunate enough to get my hands on one… it’s a wonderful guitar! The pickups are really great and have a unique voice… its hard to believe PRS can make such a great guitar at this price point. I would highly recommend this guitar to anyone who wants a beefed up strat style guitar with a slightly slinkier feel."

# SE NF 53

# Vintage Spirit. Timeless Tone.

The PRS SE NF 53 is a powerful, modern guitar inspired by classic tones and design. Built on the foundation of a swamp ash body and 22-fret, 25.5” scale length bolt-on maple neck and fretboard, the PRS SE NF 53 embodies the spirit of the electric guitar in the most timeless way. The addition of PRS Narrowfield DD “S” pickups brings a lot of power and musicality without the hum, making this guitar uniquely PRS.

PRS Narrowfield DD (Deep Dish) “S” pickups are made with taller bobbins to fit more winds and extra metal pieces in between the magnets for a focused, powerful tone. The “S” variation of these pickups brings articulate low-end tones and the snarl and twang you’d expect from this instrument – all as a noiseless humbucker, making it extremely receptive to gain. Paired with a volume and tone control and 3-way blade pickup switch, the NF 53 allows players to easily dial in their sound. Finally, the steel plate-style bridge with brass barrel saddles adds to the PRS SE NF 53’s lively tone and resonance.

# SE Swamp Ash Special

# Fresh Face and Versatile Voice

The PRS SE Swamp Ash Special is a unique offering in the growing PRS SE Series. With a swamp ash body and 22-fret maple neck with maple fretboard, the SE Swamp Ash Special is a fresh face and versatile voice.

The 85/15 “S” pickups flank a PRS-Designed AS-01 Single Coil “S” pickup in the middle position. The AS-01 Single Coil features both alnico and steel (hence the name), which adds mass to the pickups helping to create a powerful sound. Paired with a push/pull tone control and 5-way pickup switch, this pickup/electronics package gives players an array of sounds to enjoy, and the addition of PRS’s patented tremolo adds a touch more versatility. The overall tone of the PRS SE Swamp Ash Special offers tight low-end, bright but mellow high-end, and a welcome twangy tone that can reach “hot country,” blues, and even jazz territory.

# SE Studio

# Explore the Possibilities

The PRS SE Studio features a trio of powerful pickups in a sleek design, bridging the gap between classic tones and modern versatility.

Built with a mahogany back and maple top, the PRS SE Studio delivers rich, resonant tones, thanks also to its “single”/”single”/hum pickup configuration. This combination of PRS Narrowfield DD “S” bass and middle pickups with a PRS 58/15 LT “S” treble humbucker provides a wide range of tonal options, including lush humbucking warmth, single-coil clarity, and everything in between. The 5-way blade switch and push/pull tone control further enhance its versatility, making this guitar a tonal chameleon for any genre or playing style.

The 22-fret, 25” scale-length maple neck features a Wide Thin carve for a comfortable, authoritative playing experience, and the rosewood fretboard is adorned with PRS’s iconic bird inlays for a touch of class. With PRS-designed tuners and our patented tremolo bridge, the SE Studio offers rock-solid tuning stability and expressive performance, all at an accessible price point.

Whether you’re practicing at home, recording in the studio, or performing on stage, the PRS SE Studio provides an addictive playing experience.

### PRS-Designed Tuners

## Accolades

“The PRS SE line packs a punch way above its weight class and they've always found a way to remain consistent with offering more value for what you get. I opened the guitar out of the box, plugged in and went straight to work. Its a blessing when you don't have to worry about the tools you use.”

- - Rony Feliz / Pitbull

“As soon as I took it out of the box, the SE Studio felt and sounded familiar to me, like fitting into a worn-in baseball glove. My introduction to PRS guitars began with the SE line, and to this day, the guitar with the most miles on tour (over 165 shows annually) is still one of my SE’s. You know they did something right when you never have to worry about your instrument; it just works and sounds amazing. PRS created that for me. The SE Studio is a home run!”

- - Rony Feliz / Pitbull

# SE Studio

# Explore the Possibilities

The PRS SE Studio features a trio of powerful pickups in a sleek design, bridging the gap between classic tones and modern versatility.

Built with a mahogany back and maple top, the PRS SE Studio delivers rich, resonant tones, thanks also to its “single”/”single”/hum pickup configuration. This combination of PRS Narrowfield DD “S” bass and middle pickups with a PRS 58/15 LT “S” treble humbucker provides a wide range of tonal options, including lush humbucking warmth, single-coil clarity, and everything in between. The 5-way blade switch and push/pull tone control further enhance its versatility, making this guitar a tonal chameleon for any genre or playing style.

The 22-fret, 25” scale-length maple neck features a Wide Thin carve for a comfortable, authoritative playing experience, and the rosewood fretboard is adorned with PRS’s iconic bird inlays for a touch of class. With PRS-designed tuners and our patented tremolo bridge, the SE Studio offers rock-solid tuning stability and expressive performance, all at an accessible price point.

Whether you’re practicing at home, recording in the studio, or performing on stage, the PRS SE Studio provides an addictive playing experience.

## Accolades

“The PRS SE line packs a punch way above its weight class and they've always found a way to remain consistent with offering more value for what you get. I opened the guitar out of the box, plugged in and went straight to work. Its a blessing when you don't have to worry about the tools you use.”

- - Rony Feliz / Pitbull

“As soon as I took it out of the box, the SE Studio felt and sounded familiar to me, like fitting into a worn-in baseball glove. My introduction to PRS guitars began with the SE line, and to this day, the guitar with the most miles on tour (over 165 shows annually) is still one of my SE’s. You know they did something right when you never have to worry about your instrument; it just works and sounds amazing. PRS created that for me. The SE Studio is a home run!”

- - Rony Feliz / Pitbull

# SE Special Semi-Hollow

# Shape Your Tone. Define Your Style.

The PRS SE Special Semi-Hollow is a versatile workhorse, perfect for players looking to explore new sonic horizons with uncompromised playability and quality. With the lush tones of a semi-hollow body and the versatility of a hum/“single”/hum setup, this guitar delivers a world of musical possibilities, bringing PRS’s innovative Narrowfield DD pickup design and intuitive coil-tap switching system to the SE Series in a classic maple top guitar. The semi-hollow construction also enhances sustain and resonance, while the f-hole adds a classic aesthetic. A 22-fret, 25” scale-length maple neck with a rosewood fretboard and PRS bird inlays ensures smooth playability and an iconic look.

The PRS SE Special Semi-Hollow is equipped with a pair of 58/15 LT “S” pickups with a PRS Narrowfield DD “S” in the middle position and a versatile coil-tap setup that unlocks a wide range of tones—from warm, full humbucker sounds to crisp single-coil chime. This three-pickup configuration allows for unique tonal options, making this model a go-to for genres ranging from jazz and blues to rock and beyond. Finished with PRS-designed tuners and the patented PRS tremolo bridge, the PRS SE Special Semi-Hollow delivers roadworthy reliability with studio-worthy tone.

## Accolades

“Awesome guitar! The Special Semi-Hollow SE brings all the versatility and playability of the Core series into a more affordable package! I was also thoroughly impressed by the pickups. I’ve always had a pet peeve with muddy neck humbuckers and icy pick bright bridge humbuckers, and with PRS’s for the first time in my life I’m not having to EQ myself out of a problem. They sound really balanced with a tight low end, a round top and a full with a nice mid range. Highly recommend grabbing one!”

# SE 277

# Texture and Versatility

Built with a longer 27.7” scale length, the SE 277 is perfect for heavier, more aggressive guitar playing. But this is no one-trick pony. The 277’s 85/15 “S” pickups were designed to deliver remarkable clarity and extended high and low end, allowing the 277 to handle blues and funk with flair as well. Additional appointments include a string-through bridge design for strong, resonant tone.

Whether you’re interested in rocking a clean tone, picking bass lines beneath higher melodies on one guitar, or chugging out the heaviest drop-tuned riffs, the SE 277 offers versatility in a reliable package for players looking to push the envelope. Ships tuned B to B.

## Accolades

"Try as I might, I couldn’t find a dang thing wrong or even slightly unsatisfying with the PRS SE 277. It’s comfortable, fun, and easy to play; has a wide range of versatile, simple-to-control tones; and proved a gleeful partner in sonic mayhem as well as a suave traditionalist.”

- Premier Guitar

"Not just for metalheads, this affordable baritone from PRS is far from a one-trick pony.”

- Guitar-Bass.net

“I love how this guitar is great at heavy and aggressive music but can play pretty much any style of music you want to play on it. This may be the most versatile of all the guitars in this review.”

# SE 277

# Texture and Versatility

Built with a longer 27.7” scale length, the SE 277 is perfect for heavier, more aggressive guitar playing. But this is no one-trick pony. The 277’s 85/15 “S” pickups were designed to deliver remarkable clarity and extended high and low end, allowing the 277 to handle blues and funk with flair as well. Additional appointments include a string-through bridge design for strong, resonant tone.

Whether you’re interested in rocking a clean tone, picking bass lines beneath higher melodies on one guitar, or chugging out the heaviest drop-tuned riffs, the SE 277 offers versatility in a reliable package for players looking to push the envelope. Ships tuned B to B.

## Additional Videos

## Accolades

"Try as I might, I couldn’t find a dang thing wrong or even slightly unsatisfying with the PRS SE 277. It’s comfortable, fun, and easy to play; has a wide range of versatile, simple-to-control tones; and proved a gleeful partner in sonic mayhem as well as a suave traditionalist.”

- Premier Guitar

"Not just for metalheads, this affordable baritone from PRS is far from a one-trick pony.”

- Guitar-Bass.net

“I love how this guitar is great at heavy and aggressive music but can play pretty much any style of music you want to play on it. This may be the most versatile of all the guitars in this review.”

# SE Mark Holcomb SVN

# Aggressive Clarity

The SE Mark Holcomb SVN model truly stands on its own in the PRS lineup and delivers addictive playability thanks to some unique specifications, including a 24-fret, 26.5” scale length, wide thin satin maple neck with 20” radius ebony fretboard. Holcomb’s signature Seymour Duncan Scarlet and Scourge 7-string pickups provide the right amount of output and articulation whether you’re playing sophisticated chords or solos and whether you’re playing alone or working in the mix of a band. Other specifications include black hardware, a 3-way blade pickup switch with push/pull tone knob for coil tapping, and a quilted maple veneer. The model is topped off with a string-through, plate-style, 7-string bridge.

“My SE SVN has become the perfect counterpart to my SE six-string, and an absolute mainstay in Periphery’s live rig. It’s designed to be aggressive, but its core features allow it to be diverse enough to handle clean and mid-gain tones just as effectively. If you’ve played my SE six, you’ll find that this builds off what we established with that guitar and more.” - Mark Holcomb, Periphery

# SE Zach Myers "Lefty"

# Unbelievable Feel and Price

The SE Zach Myers is packed with features that will satisfy even the most demanding musicians. Featuring a chambered mahogany body with maple cap, flame maple veneer, and single f-hole, the SE Zach Myers provides smooth mid-range tones with a natural, resonant internal reverb. The resonance of the semi-hollow body paired with the smooth feel of the satin finish neck will make an immediate impression in your hands. Additional appointments to the SE Zach Myers signature model include a 22-fret, 24.594” scale length neck, PRS adjustable stoptail bridge, vintage-style tuners, and PRS-designed 245 “S” pickups paired with two volume and two tone controls and a 3-way toggle pickup switch. These pickups bring high-end clarity, low-end power, and an overall aggressive punch that maintains a certain sweetness.

Zach Myers, lead guitarist of the multi-platinum rock band Shinedown, picked up a PRS Custom 22 at the age of fifteen and announced his first SE signature model in 2010. As a guitarist who has rocked PRS on stage and teched for several PRS bands, Myers has an intimate understanding of how a guitar should feel and what the build quality should be. Those details have again created an eye-popping player’s guitar that can take a beating.

# SE Silver Sky Rosewood "Lefty"

# Reach for the Sky

The SE Silver Sky is a familiar iteration of the original Silver Sky model that was first introduced with John Mayer in 2018. This workhorse guitar provides ample tone and playability in four distinct colors, delivering looks, feel, and sound.

The PRS SE Silver Sky starts with a poplar body, bolt-on maple neck, and rosewood fretboard with PRS trademark bird inlays. The 22-fret, 25.5” scale length neck features the original 635JM carve and an 8.5” fretboard radius, so the PRS SE Silver Sky will feel right at home. Plug it in, and the three single-coil 635JM “S” pick-ups will bark and sing. This guitar is anchored by a two-point steel tremolo, synthetic bone nut, and vintage-style tuners. Other design features include the PRS Silver Sky inverted headstock shape and the PRS double-acting truss rod (accessible from the front of the headstock for ease of use). Ships with PRS Classic 10-46 strings and gig bag.

This model is also available with a maple fretboard. To explore that offering, please click here.

## Additional Videos

## Featured Specifications

### PRS 2-Point Steel Tremolo

Comfortable tremolo functionality with exceptional tuning stability, featuring a classic 2-point mounting system.

### Vintage-Style Tuners

Traditional closed-back tuners engineered to promote resonance.

### PRS 635JM “S”

Full, warm vintage-inspired single coils with a musical high-end that is never “ice-picky” or brash. Designed to PRS’s specification.

# SE Silver Sky Maple "Lefty"

# Reach for the Sky

The SE Silver Sky Maple is a familiar iteration of the original Silver Sky model that was first introduced with John Mayer in 2018. This workhorse guitar provides ample tone and playability in three distinct colors, delivering looks, feel, and sound.

The PRS SE Silver Sky Maple starts with a poplar body, bolt-on maple neck, and maple fretboard with PRS trademark bird inlays. The 22-fret, 25.5” scale length neck features the original 635JM carve and an 8.5” fretboard radius, so the PRS SE Silver Sky will feel right at home. Plug it in, and the three single-coil 635JM “S” pickups will bark and sing. This guitar is anchored by a two-point steel tremolo, synthetic bone nut, and vintage-style tuners. Other design features include the PRS Silver Sky inverted headstock shape and the PRS double-acting truss rod (accessible from the front of the headstock for ease of use). Ships with PRS Classic 10-46 strings and gig bag.

This model is also available with a rosewood fretboard. To explore that offering, please click here.

# SE DGT

# Meticulously Vintage

“I didn’t just rubber stamp this. This guitar is something I have been very involved in and am really proud of. The SE Series is lightyears ahead of anything I could get my hands on when I started playing - it’s amazing how far the quality has come – and I am proud to be able to offer this guitar to more people.” - David Grissom

The PRS SE DGT (David Grissom Trem) brings David Grissom’s signature model to the SE Series for the first time. Based on the McCarty platform, the DGT model has been a constant favorite since its introduction in 2007, thanks to Grissom’s deep knowledge of vintage guitars and his painstaking attention to detail. Every feature on the SE DGT has been considered from the neck shape to the fret choice and dressing, from the colors to the pickups and electronics layout.

The SE DGT features vintage-voiced humbuckers paired with individual volume controls for each pickup and a push/pull master tone control that taps the humbuckers for sweet, single-coil inspired sounds. This layout puts a lot of control and versatility on tap so you can focus on playing and not the guitar. Additional appointments include a maple top, mahogany back, 22-fret, 25” scale length mahogany neck with rosewood fretboard, and bird or moon inlays (inlays are color dependent).

# SE Santana

# Legendary Tone

Carlos Santana’s influence as a PRS artist led to the development of our SE electric guitar series, which launched in 2001. In honor of that legacy, PRS is proud to offer the SE Santana model. The SE Santana features a 24.594” scale length on a 24 fret neck, the PRS patented molded tremolo, Santana “S” humbuckers, and the same Santana body shape silhouette as Santana’s revered American-made PRS models. We believe this guitar and its appointments honor Santana’s skill and style better than ever and offer players great quality and value. Be sure to try an SE Santana at an authorized dealer near you.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Patented Tremolo

Patented design, delivering tonal fidelity, player comfort, and tuning stability.

### PRS-Designed Tuners

Designed to PRS's specifications, these lightweight tuners provide precise tuning and won't dampen your tone.

### PRS Santana “S”

# SE Mark Holcomb

# Mercilessly Addictive

The band Periphery has become a force to be reckoned with in the progressive metal scene thanks to their complex rhythms and soaring melodies. Guitarist Mark Holcomb helps achieve this full, lethal sound with his PRS guitars and signature Seymour Duncan Scarlet and Scourge pickups. PRS and Holcomb have worked closely together to develop a truly unique guitar for the SE Series lineup.

"With my SE signature model, we managed to capture all of the defining characteristics of my Maryland-made guitar and turn it into a streamlined, less-costly package. It is an incredibly special instrument, and one that is now the primary focus of my rig in the studio and onstage." - Mark Holcomb, Periphery

The SE Mark Holcomb model truly stands on its own in the PRS lineup and delivers addictive playability thanks to some unique specifications, including a 24-fret, 25.5” scale length wide thin satin maple neck with 20” radius ebony fretboard. Holcomb’s signature pickups provide the right amount of output and articulation whether you’re playing sophisticated chords or solos and whether you’re playing alone or working in the mix of a band. Other specifications include a quilted maple veneer, black chrome hardware, and a 3-way blade pickup switch with push/pull tone knob for coil tapping.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Plate Style (String Through)

Designed with individual saddles for perfect intonation and string-through design for increased resonance and sustain.

### PRS-Designed Tuners

Designed to PRS's specifications, these lightweight tuners provide precise tuning and won't dampen your tone.

### Mark Holcomb Signature Seymour Duncan “Scarlet” & “Scourge”

The right amount of output to deliver aggression with clarity and articulation.

## Accolades

"This PRS SE is super playable, sleek, and has monstrous tone...we think this is one of the most exciting guitars so far this year! At the price, we also think it’s a fabulous value for the money.”

- Guitar Interactive

"The spec on offer here represents a high quality and, dare we say it, ‘posh’ metal guitar with a little bit extra under the hood thanks to the split-coil tones.”

# SE Paul's Guitar

# Paul’s Favorite Features In Your Hands

“The SE Paul’s Guitar is a great example of design, engineering, and teamwork. It’s as close to home as we could get inside of the SE Series, and I am very proud of it,” - Paul Reed Smith

The SE Paul’s Guitar delivers a lot of “PRS,” starting with tone and versatility. The TCI “S” treble and bass pickups deliver a pure, vintage sound. The SE Paul’s Guitar also features two mini-toggle switches between the volume and tone knobs, which enable you to coil tap both pickups independently, yielding eight total pickup combinations. The PRS stoptail bridge is the same machined stoptail with brass inserts as spec'd on the Core Paul's Guitar.

“The Paul’s Guitar, like the Modern Eagle before it, has always been about Paul’s latest discoveries in guitar making. To bring this guitar into the SE Series, we knew the tone, functionality, and playability had to be right and had to be consistent,” said Jack Higginbotham, COO, PRS Guitars. “We feel this guitar offers a lot of value to players.”

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Stoptail with Brass Inserts

Engineered with curved string slots with brass inserts and brass studs to take full advantage of the resonant properties of the guitar.

### Vintage-Style Tuners

Traditional closed-back tuners engineered to promote resonance.

### PRS TCI “S”

Musical pickups that offer versatile tones from spanky single coils to full soapbars. Designed to PRS’s specification.

## Accolades

“The import version of Paul’s Guitar delivers a big dollop of the sort of looks you get from a high-end PRS, and the sound and playability make it feel much more expensive than it is.”

- Premier Guitar

“Aside from the effortless playability, intonation, tuning stability and old-world resonance (all foundations of the PRS empire), the single-coil voices from these new TCI pickups raise the bar, while the humbucking side seems to pack musical heat, clarity and considerable versatility in equal measure.”

# SE Paul's Guitar

# Paul’s Favorite Features In Your Hands

“The SE Paul’s Guitar is a great example of design, engineering, and teamwork. It’s as close to home as we could get inside of the SE Series, and I am very proud of it,” - Paul Reed Smith

The SE Paul’s Guitar delivers a lot of “PRS,” starting with tone and versatility. The TCI “S” treble and bass pickups deliver a pure, vintage sound. The SE Paul’s Guitar also features two mini-toggle switches between the volume and tone knobs, which enable you to coil tap both pickups independently, yielding eight total pickup combinations. The PRS stoptail bridge is the same machined stoptail with brass inserts as spec'd on the Core Paul's Guitar.

“The Paul’s Guitar, like the Modern Eagle before it, has always been about Paul’s latest discoveries in guitar making. To bring this guitar into the SE Series, we knew the tone, functionality, and playability had to be right and had to be consistent,” said Jack Higginbotham, COO, PRS Guitars. “We feel this guitar offers a lot of value to players.”

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Stoptail with Brass Inserts

Engineered with curved string slots with brass inserts and brass studs to take full advantage of the resonant properties of the guitar.

### Vintage-Style Tuners

Traditional closed-back tuners engineered to promote resonance.

### PRS TCI “S”

Musical pickups that offer versatile tones from spanky single coils to full soapbars. Designed to PRS’s specification.

## Accolades

“The import version of Paul’s Guitar delivers a big dollop of the sort of looks you get from a high-end PRS, and the sound and playability make it feel much more expensive than it is.”

- Premier Guitar

“Aside from the effortless playability, intonation, tuning stability and old-world resonance (all foundations of the PRS empire), the single-coil voices from these new TCI pickups raise the bar, while the humbucking side seems to pack musical heat, clarity and considerable versatility in equal measure.”

# SE Zach Myers

# Unbelievable Feel and Price

The SE Zach Myers is packed with features that will satisfy even the most demanding musicians. Featuring a chambered mahogany body with maple cap, flame maple veneer, and single f-hole, the SE Zach Myers provides smooth mid-range tones with a natural, resonant internal reverb. The resonance of the semi-hollow body paired with the smooth feel of the satin finish neck will make an immediate impression in your hands. Additional appointments to the SE Zach Myers signature model include a 22-fret, 24.594” scale length neck, PRS adjustable stoptail bridge, vintage-style tuners, and PRS-designed 245 “S” pickups paired with two volume and two tone controls and a 3-way toggle pickup switch. These pickups bring high-end clarity, low-end power, and an overall aggressive punch that maintains a certain sweetness.

Zach Myers, lead guitarist of the multi-platinum rock band Shinedown, picked up a PRS Custom 22 at the age of fifteen and announced his first SE signature model in 2010. As a guitarist who has rocked PRS on stage and teched for several PRS bands, Myers has an intimate understanding of how a guitar should feel and what the build quality should be. Those details have again created an eye-popping player’s guitar that can take a beating.

“When I was younger, I always wanted a “Private Stock” guitar, but I couldn’t afford one. When I told Paul the SE Zach Myers reminded me of that, he laughed, but also slightly agreed. The goal of the PRS SE Zach Myers has always been to make a guitar that stood out in the long line of amazing, affordable guitars that is the SE Series. The appointments we selected for this guitar, I feel, make it one of the best guitars you buy on the market right now – no matter the price point…even though this guitar is priced for everyone to afford. I hope players of all styles and levels enjoy it.” – Zach Myers

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Adjustable Stoptail

Stoptail bridge design with individually adjustable saddles for ease of intonation.

### Vintage-Style Tuners

Traditional closed-back tuners engineered to promote resonance.

### PRS 245 “S” Pickups

High-end clarity, smooth midrange tones, and low-end power that combine to provide a sweet but aggressive punch.

## Accolades

"The PRS SE Zach Myers is a well-realized and well-built instrument that, quite honestly, can stand toe-to-toe with semi-hollows that cost four times its price. But beyond its obvious hard-rock pedigree, it’s a very versatile instrument that can handle most any genre of music. In fact, the SE Zach Myers is a top-notch axe capable of so much that it almost seems criminally underpriced."

# SE Silver Sky Rosewood

# Reach For The Sky

The SE Silver Sky is a familiar iteration of the original Silver Sky model that was first introduced with John Mayer in 2018. This workhorse guitar provides ample tone and playability in four distinct colors, delivering looks, feel, and sound.

The PRS SE Silver Sky starts with a poplar body, bolt-on maple neck, and rosewood fretboard with PRS trademark bird inlays. The 22-fret, 25.5” scale length neck features the original 635JM carve and an 8.5” fretboard radius, so the PRS SE Silver Sky will feel right at home. Plug it in, and the three single-coil 635JM “S” pickups will bark and sing. This guitar is anchored by a two-point steel tremolo, synthetic bone nut, and vintage-style tuners. Other design features include the PRS Silver Sky inverted headstock shape and the PRS double-acting truss rod (accessible from the front of the headstock for ease of use). Ships with PRS Classic 10-46 strings and gig bag.

This model is also available with a maple fretboard. To explore that offering, please click here.

# SE Silver Sky Rosewood

# Reach For The Sky

The SE Silver Sky is a familiar iteration of the original Silver Sky model that was first introduced with John Mayer in 2018. This workhorse guitar provides ample tone and playability in four distinct colors, delivering looks, feel, and sound.

The PRS SE Silver Sky starts with a poplar body, bolt-on maple neck, and rosewood fretboard with PRS trademark bird inlays. The 22-fret, 25.5” scale length neck features the original 635JM carve and an 8.5” fretboard radius, so the PRS SE Silver Sky will feel right at home. Plug it in, and the three single-coil 635JM “S” pickups will bark and sing. This guitar is anchored by a two-point steel tremolo, synthetic bone nut, and vintage-style tuners. Other design features include the PRS Silver Sky inverted headstock shape and the PRS double-acting truss rod (accessible from the front of the headstock for ease of use). Ships with PRS Classic 10-46 strings and gig bag.

This model is also available with a maple fretboard. To explore that offering, please click here.

# SE DGT Laurel Burl Limited Edition

# Vintage Voice with a Distinctive Design

The PRS SE DGT is the result of years of collaboration with Texas-based PRS signature artist David Grissom. This limited edition model features a striking laurel burl veneer, blending unique aesthetics and high-performance features.

With a 25” scale length, 22 frets, and a PRS patented molded tremolo, the SE DGT delivers effortless playability and versatility. Under the hood, the SE DGT is equipped with custom-voiced PRS DGT “S” pickups, designed to deliver everything from vintage-inspired warmth to more saturated and powerful mid-gain tones. The unique DGT control layout, including separate volume controls for each pickup and a push/pull tone pot for coil-splitting, allows players to seamlessly navigate a wide range of tones with exceptional control and clarity.

Whether you’re delivering soulful leads, complex rhythms, or delicate single-coil textures, this guitar is designed to handle it all with ease and responsiveness.

Only 1,000 of these instruments will be made for 2025.

# Private Stock 40th Anniversary McCarty Dragon

# Celebrating Four Decades of Craftsmanship & Innovation

The PRS Private Stock 40th Anniversary McCarty Dragon embodies the spirit of PRS, showcasing stunning visual design and uncompromised playability and tone.

“When I was a teenager, I had a dream about a guitar with a dragon inlaid down the neck. That dream became reality for the first time in 1992 and has since become an important part of our history. For our 40th Anniversary, we have chosen a McCarty model as the foundation of the Dragon, which is only fitting considering the original 1992 Dragon was the beginning of what would become the McCarty model. I’m proud to bring these two, now-historic, PRS designs together.” – Paul Reed Smith, Founder & Managing General Partner, PRS Guitars

The PRS McCarty model was first introduced in 1994 and was essentially PRS’s first 22-fret, vintage-leaning instrument. Featuring a slightly thicker mahogany back, stoptail bridge with brass inserts and steel studs, and PRS’s new McCarty III pickups, the Private Stock 40th Anniversary McCarty Dragon is not just a work of art, it is a professional-grade, musical instrument. Every inch of the stoptail bridge is designed to maximize the transfer of the strings’ vibration through the instrument and the McCarty III pickups amplify that tone with a lush, vocal quality that is warm, clear, and open.

The visual draw of this guitar is the extraordinary dragon inlay drawn by Jeff Easley, a fantasy artist famous for many Dungeons & Dragons rulebook covers, and designed and recreated as inlay by the team at Aulson Inlay. The Dragon is comprised of more than 200 pieces of inlay in an array of materials, including Blue Pacific Opal, Brown Scale Juma, and Gold, Black, White, and Brown Mother of Pearl. The inlay extends onto the truss rod cover and visually leaps off the pale moon ebony fretboard. The Private Stock Eagle inlaid on the headstock is made from Black with Gold Web and outlined in Gold Mother of Pearl.

“I feel fortunate to have worked on PRS Dragons since 2002. Being part of this endeavor has made me feel connected to something greater that will endure beyond my time. Moreover, I have thoroughly enjoyed collaborating with Paul through the years. His ability to challenge me to step outside my comfort zone has facilitated the development of innovative techniques that make the previously impossible achievable. Through Paul’s unwavering support, our team at Aulson Inlay has evolved into an exceptional collaborative. I often wish Larry Sifel could witness the significant progress Paul and the dragons have made since the inception of the Dragon in 1992.” – Jaime Aulson Myers, Co-Founder & Co-Owner of Aulson Inlay

Only 165 Private Stock 40th Anniversary McCarty Dragon models will be made.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS Stoptail w/ Brass Inserts & Steel Studs

Engineered with curved string slots with brass inserts and steel studs, this bridge is designed to maximize the transfer of the strings’ vibrations through the instrument.

### PRS Phase III Non-Locking Tuners

With vintage elegance, these lightweight tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS McCarty III Pickups

Vintage-inspired pickups that bring a vocal clarity to their full, warm tone.

# Private Stock John McLaughlin Limited Edition

“Playing music is a way of being. Playing an instrument requires you to move out of the normal level of consciousness. If you’re thinking, you’re not playing. If you’re playing, you’re not thinking. If you have problems with your instrument, you’re not going to move out of the thinking zone and into your own world. This is why I love my guitar. For me, it’s perfect.” – John McLaughlin

The PRS Private Stock John McLaughlin is a classic instrument that has been meticulously spec’d by Paul Reed Smith to honor John McLaughlin. All of the woods were specially chosen by Smith for their tone, figure, and weight. The specs are fairly straightforward: maple top, mahogany back, hormigo neck (a tone wood used on marimbas for sound-producing tines) with an African blackwood fretboard, 22 frets, 25” scale length, Pattern neck, PRS’s patented Gen III tremolo, and PRS Phase III tuners.

Some of the more particular details on this model are in the finish, pickups, and electronics. The guitar is finished in high-gloss nitro with an unfinished neck with clear grain filler for a smooth, natural playing feel. The TCI pickups feature American Alnico and are paired with volume and tone controls with a 3-way toggle pickup switch and two mini-toggle EQ switches. The mini-toggles act as tuned high-pass filters when engaged (in the up position), removing shelved low-end and allowing the high frequencies through for more clarity and musical highs.

“Being John’s guitar maker is an honor I fought decades for, and to now be able to give him a signature model is a special moment for me and hopefully the industry,” said Paul Reed Smith. “These guitars were designed to both feel like magic when you pick them up but also disappear in your hands so you can just focus on playing. John is capable of playing at extraordinary speed and with this instrument, you hear every note. Finding that balance as a guitar maker and coaxing every bit of sound out of the guitar was the key.”

Paul Reed Smith and Paul Miles have signed each Private Stock John McLaughlin model on the back of the headstock. As an added detail, John McLaughlin has autographed the back- plate of each instrument. Only 200 PRS Private Stock John McLaughlin guitars will be made in 2023.

## Featured Specifications

### PRS TCI Pickups

Musical pickups that offer versatile tones from spanky singlecoils to full soapbars.

### PRS Phase III Locking Tuners

Modern locking technology with vintage elegance, these tuners promote tone transfer for a louder, more resonant instrument.

### PRS Patented Tremolo

Meticulous design delivering sonic fidelity, player ergonomics, and revolutionary tuning stability.

# Private Stock Orianthi Limited Edition

Orianthi is known for working with top musicians, including Carlos Santana, Alice Cooper, Carrie Underwood, and Michael Jackson, and PRS guitars have been in her hands every step of the way. This limited edition is based on the in-demand guitarist’s personalized Custom 24 first made as a one-off artist build by the Private Stock team in 2017.

The Private Stock Orianthi Limited Edition keeps many of the specs as that original artist build, including a figured maple top, mahogany back, and a 24-fret, 25” scale length, Pattern Thin mahogany neck with rosewood fretboard. Like the original, the fretboard is adorned with a custom “Lotus Vine” inlay (similar to PRS’s classic “Tree of Life” design) that was inspired by a pen Orianthi sent to the team. The inlay is made from Asian Pink Coral and mother of pearl. Newly developed to showcase the Private Stock grade figured maple, the Private Stock Orianthi Limited Edition comes in Blooming Lotus Glow, which has a pink center glow that fades outward to a similar purple as the original artist build, which was opaque rather than hand stained.

The electronics feature a volume and tone control with 5-way blade pickup switch, func- tioning the same way as a PRS Custom 24. The Private Stock Orianthi Limited Edition is outfitted with 58/15 treble and bass pickups, which offer a round tone.

There is no limit to the number of Private Stock Orianthi models that will be made, but the order window is limited to January 11 – December 31, 2022. Contact your Authorized PRS Private Stock Dealer to place your order.

# Private Stock Paul's 85

# A Lifetime in the Making

When a selection of wide-curl maple tops were making their way into the Private Stock Wood Vault, Paul Reed Smith knew they should be saved for something special. That special something ended up being the Paul’s 85.

Paul’s 85 are a special run of Private Stock guitars, painstakingly spec’d by Paul Reed Smith and meticulously crafted by the Private Stock team. Paul picked the tops, the selection of woods, assisted on the neck shapes of every guitar, spec’d the pickups, and played and adjusted each guitar until it was “right.” The team executed each detail while he looked after each instrument on a daily basis.

The chosen specifications also include dark Peruvian mahogany necks, Honduran rosewood fretboards and headstock veneers, solid red abalone birds with mother of pearl outlines, bone nuts, vintage-style tuning pegs, and aluminum stoptail bridges with brass inserts and brass studs.

Every piece of guitar-making knowledge at PRS is also in these guitars: the wood drying methods, the feel of the neck, the color and stain technique (Electric Tiger Glow – an exquisite stain and spray technique that accentuates the beautiful wide curl maple), the finish (a very special paper-thin, vintage-formula nitrocellulose that will crack over time), and the pickups (PRS TCI pickups that were spec’d to be full, clear, and musical).

These guitars are available exclusively through Authorized PRS Private Stock dealers, and there are only 85 of them worldwide.

“We believe guitar making is an ongoing process of discovery, and this Paul’s 85 guitar utilizes all of the parts, processes, and workmanship I have spent my career (to date) seeking, testing, refining, and teaching our craftsman. My hope is that these benchmark instruments are something remarkable for our company and the industry. There is no better way to close out our 35th Anniversary than with these extraordinary, hopefully magic, guitars.” – Paul Reed Smith

# Private Stock 35th Anniversary Dragon

Paul Reed Smith Dragon model guitars are among the most coveted PRS models ever developed. PRS is proud to celebrate this historic model in honor of PRS Guitars’ 35th anniversary in 2020.

“When I was a teenager, I had a dream about a guitar with a dragon inlaid down the neck, and in 1992, I was able to realize that dream for the first time. It has become an important part of our history to celebrate the technology that allows us to create these intricate inlays and the idea that dreams can become reality. I really like this new 35th Anniversary Dragon.” – Paul Reed Smith

The visual star of the guitar is the elaborate, fantastical dragon inlay designed by Jeff Easley, a fantasy artist famous for some of Dungeons & Dragons rulebook covers. PRS Guitars engaged Aulson Inlay, to deconstruct Easley’s artwork and recreate it into several distinctive sections that have been embedded into the fretboard of the guitar and conclude with the dragon’s breath of fire extending onto the truss rod cover. The finished inlay is fashioned from a wide array of materials including: Green Ripple Abalone, Green Abalone Select, Black Mother of Pearl, Stabilized Sand-Shaded Holly, Red with Gold Vein Recon Stone, Raffir Stripes Black, Black and Red Raffir Aluminum Wave, Abaloid Acrylic, Nocturne Corian, as well as Blue Pacific, Citrine, and Flame Synthetic Opal.

The 35th Anniversary Dragon is based off of the PRS McCarty model, featuring a thicker back, PRS Stoptail bridge, and a classic volume, push/pull tone control, and 3-way toggle electronics layout, but with TCI model pickups from the Paul’s Guitar and PRS Tweaked Phase III Locking Tuners for a unique balance of vintage and modern specifications. The extraordinary Private Stock grade tone woods were hand selected for this limited series and include a curly maple top, African ribbon mahogany back, and a chaltecoco Pattern neck with a 25” scale length, 22 fret ziricote fingerboard.

35th Anniversary Dragons will come finished in Frostbite Dragon’s Breath. Choosing one of Private Stock’s Dragon’s Breath style finishes was the perfect choice for this run, with the stain sporting a lighter color (or “glow”) toward the belly of the guitar that mimics the shape of a flame shooting out of a dragon’s mouth. The smoked black hardware brings a fierce elegance to the instrument.

“Looking at the final 35th Anniversary Dragon, I am incredibly proud. This guitar is PRS through and through from designing the fingerboard to deciding what pickups to put in it. I think it’s one of our most elegant Dragons yet.” – Paul Miles

The Private Stock 35th Anniversary Dragon will be limited to 135 pieces worldwide. Shipping between February and June 2020.

# Private Stock McCarty 594 “Graveyard Limited”

# Vintage Inspiration

PRS Guitars was recently able to purchase more than 150 curly maple tops from the outskirts of a Graveyard on top of a mountain on the East Coast of the USA. The Gravestones were dated around 1884, and the trees were clearly at least that old as they were forty feet to the first limb. The trees were logged in 2017, and the tops very closely resemble the wood used on guitars coming out of Kalamazoo in 1959. Paul Smith said it appeared to him to be some sort of sub-species of “Michigan” red maple, but with more thought it may just be the age of the tree. Regardless, these are Private Stock quality tops with medium wide to wide curl and extraordinary flame that has an iridescence to it.

For this limited edition Graveyard Guitar, the PRS Private Stock team has spec’d a beautiful, vintage-inspired McCarty 594. Notable specifications include solid red abalone birds and headstock eagle, curly maple binding along the fingerboard and veneer, and thin, vintage nitro Honey Gold with a Dark Cherry Smoked Burst finish (weather checking will happen over time).

This PRS Private Stock McCarty 594 “Graveyard Limited” will be limited to 80 pieces.

# Private Stock McCarty 594 Graveyard II Limited

# Vintage Inspiration

The PRS Private Stock McCarty 594 "Graveyard II Limited" 60–piece run is made up of visually–stunning guitars with a story to tell. The maple tops of these instruments are from trees found on the outskirts of a Graveyard at the top of a mountain on the East Coast of the USA. The Gravestones there were dated around 1884, and the trees were clearly at least that old as they were forty feet to the first limb. These tops feature medium–wide to wide curl and extraordinary flame that has an iridescence to it.

The ebony and Faded Gray maple fretboard with ebony "Ravens in Flight" inlay, Raven headstock veneer, and Raven’s Heart high–gloss nitro finish were all inspired by the story of these maple tops.

"Our artistry does not live on a square canvas. It’s colors, inlays, and wood combinations; it’s a guitar," said Paul Miles, Director of Private Stock. "We’re always trying to evolve Private Stock. This guitar very much represents that."

Just sixty PRS Private Stock McCarty 594 "Graveyard II Limited" instruments will be made. Starts shipping in December 2018.

# Private Stock Super Eagle

# Transcendent Tone

The Private Stock “Super Eagle” is the result of a very close collaboration between Paul Reed Smith and Grammy-winning musician John Mayer. The goal of the partnership was to create a highly-sophisticated and unique instrument that at once reveres the history of guitar-making and guitar tone but pushes the boundaries of materials, design, and craftsmanship. The result is a truly new PRS instrument that embodies the PRS Private Stock culture of meticulous workmanship as well as Mayer’s keen eye for playability, tone, and detail.

Some of the more distinctive and personalized specifications Mayer and Smith decided on for this special run of instruments include a longer (for PRS) scale length of 25.375”, specially-wound 58/15 JM treble and bass pickups with a specially-wound Narrowfield JM pickup in the middle position (with three individual coil-tap mini-switches), a JCF Audio preamp with treble boost, as well as a hand-signed sticker in the f-hole of the guitar that was designed by Mayer’s friend David Smith (who also designed the cover art for Mayer’s 2012 Born and Raised album). The pickups deliver a bright, clear tone that has been heard in venues across the USA in Mayer’s recent performances with Dead & Company.

But according to Mayer, this guitar won’t stop with Dead & Company. “Paul and I worked very closely to create this guitar, and the result is an incredibly refined and elegant instrument. It has a completely new sound and spirit. It's been a joy to play and I'm excited to share that experience with other guitar players” - John Mayer.

The Private Stock Super Eagle is available for order from March 11, 2016 – April 1, 2016 only. PRS will also be capping production at 100 instruments. To order your Private Stock Super Eagle, please contact an Authorized PRS Dealer. Full specifications are below.

# Private Stock Super Eagle II

# Transcendent Tone

It’s no secret that John Mayer’s main guitar on tour with Dead & Company has been the PRS Super Eagle, launched last spring. During the 2016 tour, PRS made Mayer a second version of that instrument with some updated woods and aesthetic appointments. Mayer played the Super Eagle II on the very last show of the 2016 tour and is continuing to play it for Dead & Company’s 2017 summer tour. PRS and Mayer are excited to offer this new version, the Super Eagle II, to fans and collectors.

“Just like with the first edition Super Eagle, you’re literally getting the same guitar that is in John’s rig. It’s been an honor to help create a tool that John can use to work with Dead & Company and beyond,” said Paul Reed Smith.

Some of the specifications Mayer and Smith collaborated on for this special run of instruments include a longer (for PRS) scale length of 25.375”, specially-wound 58/15 JM treble and bass pickups with a specially-wound Narrowfield JM pickup in the middle position (with three individual coil-tap mini-switches), a JCF Audio preamp with treble boost, as well as a hand-signed sticker in the f-hole of the guitar that was designed by Mayer’s friend David Smith (who also designed the cover art for Mayer’s 2012 “Born and Raised” album). The pickups deliver a bright, clear tone that has been heard in venues across the USA in Mayer’s recent performances with Dead & Company.

Some new woods and aesthetic choices were also selected for the Super Eagle II, including a one piece Private Stock curly maple back, African blackwood fingerboard and headstock veneer, paua birds and a green ripple abalone 12th fret violin bird and Private Stock eagle, as well as a new color: Hemp Green.

The Private Stock Super Eagle II is a highly-sophisticated instrument that at once reveres the history of guitar-making and guitar tone but pushes the boundaries of materials, design, and craftsmanship. The resulting instrument embodies the PRS Private Stock culture of meticulous workmanship as well as Mayer’s keen eye for playability, tone, and detail.

The Private Stock Super Eagle II will be limited to 120 instruments. Full specifications are below.

# Private Stock Special Semi-Hollow Limited Edition

Reintroduced in 2021, the PRS Special Semi-Hollow is a versatile and beautiful instrument. This Private Stock Special Semi-Hollow Limited Edition keeps many of the appointments of the Core model, includ- ing a 22-fret, 25” scale length neck, semi-hollow body with single f-hole, and hum-Narrowfield-hum pickup configuration, and adds Private Stock material choices and craftsmanship for a unique small batch of guitars.

This Private Stock limited edition features stunning woods from the Private Stock Vault, including a highly-figured maple top, a Black Limba back and neck, ziricote fretboard, truss rod cover, and head- stock veneer. Finished with white mother of pearl and paua inlays, smoked black hardware, and a high- gloss nitro Citrus Glow finish, these instruments are true examples of the Private Stock team at work.

“What I love about running Limited Edition instruments in Private Stock is that it gives the team the opportunity to showcase our work on our own terms,” said Paul Miles, PRS Director of Private Stock. “We chose the Special Semi-Hollow model because the pickup and electronics configuration is extremely versatile, providing highly musical tones. The choice of Black Limba for the back and neck add to the tonal balance while the smoked black hardware against the Citrus Glow finish create a dramatic aesthetic contrast.”

Built with players in mind, Private Stock instruments take the craft of guitar-making to the next level, so collectors, art aficionados, and musicians alike will enjoy.

Only 85 of these PRS Private Stock Special Semi-Hollow Limited Edition instruments will be made.
